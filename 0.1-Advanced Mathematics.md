Differential calculus is a mathematical tool for studying the rate of change of functions, helping us understand how a quantity changes at a specific instant. 

Integral calculus, on the other hand, focuses on accumulation processes, such as calculating the area under irregular curves or the total displacement of an object. 

Multivariable calculus extends the concepts of differentiation and integration from single-variable functions to functions with multiple variables, which is essential when dealing with real-world problems where multiple factors jointly affect an outcome. 

## Differential Calculus

Differential calculus' central concept is the **derivative**. **The derivative describes the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a particular point.** 

- For example, suppose I’m driving a car and the speedometer reads 60 km/h—this speed is actually the derivative of my position with respect to time. Mathematically, if my position is a function of time, say s(t) = t², then my instantaneous velocity at t=3 seconds is the derivative of this function at t=3. We calculate derivatives using the concept of limits, with the formula: f'(x) = lim (h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h. For s(t) = t², the derivative is s'(t) = 2t, so at t=3, the velocity is 6 m/s (assuming meters and seconds). 

**Geometrically, the derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve at a given point.** 

- For instance, the slope of the tangent line to the parabola y = x² at the point (2,4) is 4. 

We also learned various differentiation rules, such as the product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule, which help us compute derivatives of complex functions efficiently. 

- For example, for the composite function y = sin(x²), we use the chain rule: first differentiate the outer function sin(u), then multiply by the derivative of the inner function u = x², resulting in y' = cos(x²) * 2x.

## Integral Calculus

Integral calculus can be seen as the "reverse" of differential calculus. If differentiation is about "breaking down" change, **integration is about "adding up" total quantities. A common application is calculating the area under a curve.** 

- For example, suppose I want to find the area between the graph of y = x and the x-axis from x=0 to x=2. This shape is actually a right triangle with base 2 and height 2, so the area is (1/2)*2*2 = 2. 

But for a more complex curve, like y = x² from x=0 to x=1, we can't use simple geometry. That's where definite integrals come in. The integral symbol is ∫, for example, ∫₀¹ x² dx. The basic idea is to divide the interval [0,1] into many small subintervals, each of width Δx. On each subinterval, we approximate the area with a rectangle and sum up all these small areas. As Δx approaches zero, this sum approaches the exact area. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Newton-Leibniz formula), if F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x)—meaning F'(x) = f(x)—then ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a). For ∫₀¹ x² dx, an antiderivative of x² is (1/3)x³, so the result is (1/3)(1)³ - (1/3)(0)³ = 1/3. This can also be interpreted as the total displacement from time 0 to 1 second if velocity is given by x².

## Multivariable Calculus

Multivariable calculus extends the single-variable functions we studied earlier to functions with multiple variables. 

- For example, the temperature in a room isn't determined only by time—it also depends on location. So temperature T can be expressed as a function of three spatial coordinates x, y, z, and time t: T(x,y,z,t). 

In multivariable differentiation, we introduce the concept of partial derivatives. A **partial derivative** measures the rate of change of a function with respect to one variable while keeping all other variables constant. 

- For example, ∂T/∂x represents how quickly the temperature changes in the x-direction when y, z, and t are held fixed. This is like looking at a map and only caring about temperature changes from east to west, ignoring north-south or vertical changes. 

We also studied the **gradient**, which is a vector made up of all the partial derivatives, pointing in the direction of the steepest increase of the function. 

- For example, for the function f(x,y) = x² + y², at the point (1,2), the partial derivative with respect to x is 2x = 2, and with respect to y is 2y = 4, so the gradient is (2,4). The gradient is crucial in machine learning and optimization because it tells us in which direction to adjust parameters to increase or decrease the objective function most quickly. 

In multivariable integration, we calculate volumes in three-dimensional space—for example, the volume of a hill—using double integrals like ∫∫ f(x,y) dxdy. This is done by dividing the base into small grids and summing up the volume of vertical columns above each grid.
