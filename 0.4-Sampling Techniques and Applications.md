In this course, I mainly studied four core sampling methods: simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling. 

These methods are fundamental tools we use in social surveys, market research, or policy evaluations to scientifically select a small subset of individuals from a large population, so that we can analyze this small sample and make inferences about the entire population. 

For example, if we want to know how much time college students across the country spend on their phones each day, it would be impossible to survey every single student—it would take too much time and effort. S**o we use sampling techniques to select a "representative team" to stand in for the whole group. This "team" must be selected fairly and scientifically—no bias, no omissions.** This course taught us exactly how to design such a fair and efficient "team selection plan."

## Simple Random Sampling

Simple random sampling is the most basic of all sampling methods, and its core idea is "complete fairness," just like drawing lots from a box full of names—every individual has exactly the same chance of being selected. 

- For instance, suppose we have a list of 10,000 college students, and we want to select 500 of them for a survey. Using simple random sampling, we assign each person a number and then use a random number generator to pick 500 numbers; the people corresponding to those numbers become our sample. 

The **advantage** of this method is that it's straightforward to implement and produces unbiased results. However, the **drawback** is that if the population has high internal variation—for example, some students use their phones for only one hour a day while others use them for eight hours—the randomly selected sample might accidentally cluster at one extreme, leading to inaccurate results. It's like a lottery: in theory, everyone has the same chance of winning, but sometimes by bad luck, all the winners come from the same college, making the results unrepresentative of the entire university.

## Stratified Sampling

分层抽样就是为了克服简单随机抽样可能带来的“运气偏差”而设计的。它的做法是先把总体按照某个重要的特征分成几个“层”，比如按性别、地区、年级或者收入水平分组，然后再在每一层内部进行随机抽样。这样做的好处是确保每个重要群体都有代表被选中，避免样本失衡。举个例子，如果我们研究大学生手机使用情况，我们知道男生和女生的使用习惯可能不同，那么我们可以先把10,000名学生按性别分成两层：5,500名男生和4,500名女生。然后我们按比例抽取，比如总共抽500人，那就从男生中随机抽275人（55%），从女生中抽225人（45%）。这样样本中男女比例和总体一致，结果就更可靠。这就像组队打比赛，不能只选高个子或只选速度快的，得按场上需要搭配不同特长的人，才能打出好成绩。

Stratified sampling is **designed to overcome the "luck bias" that can occur with simple random sampling**. The method involves first dividing the population into several "strata" based on an important characteristic—such as gender, region, grade level, or income level—and then conducting random sampling within each stratum. The benefit is that it ensures every important subgroup is represented in the sample, preventing imbalance. For example, if we're studying phone usage among college students and we know that usage habits might differ between male and female students, we could first divide the 10,000 students into two strata: 5,500 males and 4,500 females. Then we sample proportionally—say, 500 people in total—so we randomly select 275 males (55%) and 225 females (45%). This way, the gender ratio in the sample matches the population, making the results more reliable. It's like forming a sports team—you can't just pick tall players or fast runners; you need a balanced mix of different skills to perform well.

## Cluster Sampling

整群抽样则是一种更注重成本和效率的方法，特别适合当总体分布很广、个体之间距离很远的时候。它的做法是先把总体分成若干个“群”，比如按班级、宿舍楼或城市街区划分，然后随机抽取几个“群”，并对被抽中的群里的所有个体进行调查。比如说，我们想调查某大城市居民的通勤时间，全市有100个社区，每个社区大约有2,000人。如果我们用简单随机抽样，可能需要跑遍全城去访问分散的个体，成本很高。但用整群抽样，我们可以随机选5个社区，然后只调查这5个社区里的所有人，总共约10,000人。这样节省了交通和人力成本，但缺点是如果群内个体太相似，比如某个社区全是上班族，另一个全是退休老人，那么抽中的群如果刚好都是上班族社区，结果就会偏差很大。所以整群抽样的关键是要让每个“群”本身尽量像一个小的总体，内部多样性足够。

Cluster sampling is a method that prioritizes cost and efficiency, especially useful when the population is widely dispersed and individuals are far apart. The approach is to first divide the population into several "clusters," such as by class, dormitory building, or city block, then randomly select a few clusters and survey every individual within the selected clusters. For example, suppose we want to study commuting times among residents in a large city with 100 neighborhoods, each with about 2,000 people. If we used simple random sampling, we might have to travel across the entire city to interview scattered individuals, which would be very costly. With cluster sampling, we could randomly select 5 neighborhoods and then survey everyone in those 5—about 10,000 people total. This saves a lot on transportation and labor. However, the downside is that if individuals within a cluster are too similar—say, one neighborhood is all office workers, another is all retirees—and we happen to pick only office worker neighborhoods, our results could be highly biased. Therefore, the key to cluster sampling is that each "cluster" should itself resemble a small version of the overall population, with sufficient internal diversity.

## Systematic Sampling

系统抽样也叫等距抽样，它的操作方式是先确定一个抽样间隔，然后按照固定的规则每隔一定数量选一个人。比如，我们有10,000名学生，想抽500人，那抽样间隔就是10,000 ÷ 500 = 20。我们先从1到20之间随机选一个起始号码，比如第7号，然后每隔20个人选一个，也就是第7、27、47、67……一直到第9,987号，总共500人。这种方法操作简单，分布均匀，特别适合有现成名单的情况。但有一个潜在风险：如果名单本身有某种周期性规律，比如每20个人就有一个班长，而我们刚好每隔20人选一个，那可能每次都选到班长，导致样本严重偏差。所以系统抽样虽然方便，但也需要检查名单是否有隐藏的模式。

Systematic sampling, also known as equal-interval sampling, works by first determining a sampling interval and then selecting individuals at a fixed interval. For example, if we have 10,000 students and want to select 500, the sampling interval is 10,000 ÷ 500 = 20. We first randomly choose a starting number between 1 and 20—say, number 7—and then select every 20th person: the 7th, 27th, 47th, 67th, and so on, up to the 9,987th, totaling 500 people. This method is easy to implement and ensures even distribution, making it especially suitable when we have a ready-made list. However, there's a potential risk: if the list itself has a hidden periodic pattern—say, every 20th person is a class monitor—and we happen to select every 20th person, we might end up selecting only monitors, leading to serious bias. So while systematic sampling is convenient, we must also check whether the list contains any hidden patterns.
