In this course, I mainly studied system modeling and modelization, system evaluation methods, and decision analysis methods. These three parts form a core methodology for structuring and solving complex management problems in our major. 

Through this course, I not only learned how to **structure and quantify vague and complex real-world problems**, but also mastered how to **evaluate the pros and cons of different solutions and ultimately make scientific decisions**. These methods are widely used in fields such as industrial engineering, business operations, and strategic planning.

## System modeling and modelization

System modeling and modelization is about how to **transform complex real-world problems into operable mathematical models.**

- For example, when we analyzed urban traffic congestion in class, we couldn't just say "this place is congested" based on feelings. Instead, we had to use models to express the structure of this system. 

We learned a technique called Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), which analyzes causal relationships among various factors to **transform a chaotic problem into a clear hierarchical structure diagram.** 

- For instance, many factors affect traffic congestion: high number of private cars, unreasonable road design, underdeveloped public transportation, and drivers' improper behavior. 

ISM requires us to first list all these factors, then use expert scoring to determine which factors influence others, and finally use software to generate a hierarchical structure diagram—from root causes (like population growth) through intermediate factors (like increased vehicles) to top-level outcomes (traffic congestion). This way, we can clearly see which fundamental issues need to be addressed first. 

Additionally, we studied state-space models, which use "state variables" to describe how a system changes over time. 

- For example, we built a dynamic model of urban development using three variables: population size, employment rate, and GDP growth rate, simulating development trends over the next ten years through differential equations. Such models are particularly useful in policy-making and long-term planning.

## System evaluation

[Multi-attribute decision-making](14-Decision theory and method.md#Multi-attribute decision-making)

System evaluation methods are about how to **scientifically compare the advantages and disadvantages of different alternatives.**

- For example, we had a case study on selecting a new office location for a company, with five candidate sites, each performing differently in terms of rent, transportation convenience, surrounding facilities, and employee satisfaction. 

In such cases, we can't just choose based on intuition—we need systematic evaluation methods. We focused on the **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)**, which breaks down the problem into a tree structure: <u>the top level is the goal "selecting the best office location," the middle level consists of evaluation criteria (such as cost, convenience, environment), and the bottom level includes the specific alternative sites.</u> 

Then, through pairwise comparisons, decision-makers judge "how many times more important is cost than convenience?" or "how much more important is convenience than environment?" These subjective judgments are converted into numerical values, and finally, through matrix calculations, we obtain a comprehensive score for each option. 

- For instance, we calculated Site A with a score of 0.32, Site B with 0.28, and Site C with 0.40, making Site C the optimal choice. The advantage of this method is that it considers both quantitative data and integrates the decision-maker's subjective preferences, making the entire evaluation process transparent and traceable. 

We also learned the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, which handles indicators that are difficult to quantify precisely, such as "employee satisfaction" or "cultural fit," by using fuzzy mathematics to convert vague linguistic terms like "relatively high" or "moderately good" into computable values.

## Decision analysis

[Decision-making under risk and uncertainty](14-Decision theory and method.md#Decision-making under risk and uncertainty)

Decision analysis methods are about how to **make optimal choices under uncertain conditions.** Real-world decisions are rarely "certain." 

For example, when a company decides whether to invest in a new project, future market demand, raw material prices, and policy changes are all uncertain. We focused on risk-based decision analysis, with the most commonly used method being the **decision tree**. 

- For instance, we analyzed whether a company should develop a new product. The first step is to draw a decision tree: from a decision node, two branches emerge—"develop" and "not develop." If "develop" is chosen, it then faces uncertainty in market response—possibly "high demand" (60% probability) or "low demand" (40% probability). Based on market research, we estimated profits: 2 million RMB if high demand, a loss of 500,000 RMB if low demand. By calculating the expected value (0.6 × 2 + 0.4 × (-0.5) = 1 million RMB), we found that the expected profit from development is 1 million RMB, much higher than 0 RMB from not developing, thus recommending development. 

We also studied utility theory, which explains why some people prefer stable small gains over high risks. 

- For example, someone might prefer a certain 500,000 RMB over a 50% chance of 2 million RMB and a 50% chance of losing 1 million RMB because their "utility" values security more. 

Additionally, we touched on conflict analysis, such as in the "Cuban Missile Crisis" case, using game theory to analyze the strategic choices of the US and Soviet Union, understanding how to predict the opponent's behavior and make optimal responses in adversarial environments.
