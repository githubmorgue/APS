**Data Mining**, teaches students how to **discover useful patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data and apply these insights to real-world business decisions.** 

## Classification

Classification means **assigning labels to new samples based on existing data.** 

- For example, a bank wanting to decide whether a loan applicant will repay on time can use a classification model to predict if they are a "high-risk" or "low-risk" customer. 

We focused on several common classification methods, such as Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). 

## Clustering

Clustering, which differs from classification because it's an unsupervised learning method — meaning we don’t know in advance which class each sample belongs to. The goal of clustering is to **group similar objects together** and separate dissimilar ones. 

We studied two main algorithms: one called K-Means Clustering and another called DBSCAN. 

K-Means requires specifying the number of clusters in advance (e.g., k=3), then randomly selects three center points, calculates each customer’s distance to these centers, assigns them to the nearest cluster, recalculates the new center of each cluster, and repeats this process iteratively until stable. 

- This is like forming three basketball teams: first pick three random captains, then everyone joins the team whose captain is closest; after that, each team elects a new captain, members may switch teams, and the process continues until no one changes teams anymore. 

In contrast, DBSCAN is more flexible — it doesn’t require setting the number of clusters beforehand, but instead identifies clusters based on density: dense areas naturally form clusters, while sparse regions are treated as noise or outliers. 

- For example, when analyzing shared bike parking spots on a map, DBSCAN can automatically detect hotspots near subway exits or office buildings and flag isolated bikes as anomalies. In our lab exercise using a dataset of 1,000 customer transactions, we found that DBSCAN performed better than K-Means when dealing with irregularly shaped customer segments.

## Association Rules

Association Rules, which is a technique used to **find patterns in data where certain items frequently appear together.** 

- The most classic example is market basket analysis in supermarkets — for instance, we might find that many customers who buy chips also tend to buy a bottle of cola. While this kind of pattern may seem simple, there’s actually a rigorous mathematical approach behind discovering and validating it. We focused on the Apriori algorithm, which is one of the core methods for finding association rules.
