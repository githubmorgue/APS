**Decision theory and methods** is a course that teaches us how to make smart and logical choices, especially when we face uncertainty or multiple options. 

In this course, I mainly studied multi-attribute decision-making methods, decision-making under risk and uncertainty, the basics of game theory, and decision support systems. 

**These topics cover how to make choices systematically, how to balance trade-offs among multiple goals, how to deal with unknown factors, how to understand strategic choices in interactive situations, and how to use technology to assist complex decision-making.**

## Multi-attribute decision-making

Multi-attribute decision-making methods are about how to **make a comprehensive evaluation when a decision involves multiple different aspects.** 

- For example, when someone buys a house, they can’t just look at the price—they also need to consider location, size, school district, transportation convenience, and so on. These factors may conflict; for instance, a cheaper house might be far from the city center. 

In this course, we learned methods like AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process). The core idea of **AHP** is to first organize all factors into levels: the top level is the goal (e.g., “select the best home”), the middle level consists of criteria (such as price, location, size), and the bottom level includes specific alternatives (e.g., House A, B, or C). 

- Then, we quantify the importance of each criterion through pairwise comparisons. For example, if we think “location” is slightly more important than “price,” we assign it a score of 3; if “size” is much more important than “price,” we give it a score of 5. Through these comparisons, we build a judgment matrix and use mathematical methods to calculate the weight of each criterion. For instance, we might end up with weights of 30% for price, 40% for location, and 30% for size. Next, we score each house on each criterion—say, House A gets 80 on price, 60 on location, and 70 on size. Finally, we multiply each score by its corresponding weight and sum them up to get a total score. For House A, that would be 80×0.3 + 60×0.4 + 70×0.3 = 69 points. This way, we can objectively compare different options and avoid being swayed too much by one particularly outstanding factor.

## Decision-making under risk and uncertainty

Decision-making under risk and uncertainty is about how to **make choices when future outcomes are unclear.** 

- For example, a manufacturing company must decide whether to invest in a new production line, but future market demand is uncertain—it could be high or low. 

We distinguish between “risk” and “uncertainty”: **risk** means we know the probabilities of different outcomes (e.g., historical data suggests a 70% chance of high demand and 30% of low demand), while **uncertainty** means we don’t even know the probabilities. 

In such cases, we use different decision rules. The “<u>maximum expected utility criterion</u>” is the method mentioned earlier, using probability-weighted expected values. But when we lack probability information, we might use the “<u>minimax regret criterion</u>.” This method first calculates how much regret each option would cause compared to the best possible choice in each scenario. 

- For instance, if demand is high, investing earns 10 million RMB, while not investing earns only 2 million—so not investing would result in 8 million RMB of regret. If demand is low, investing loses 5 million, while not investing breaks even—so investing would have 5 million RMB of regret. We list the maximum regret for each option and then choose the one with the smallest maximum regret, thus avoiding the worst possible regret in the future. We also learned sensitivity analysis to test the stability of results—by changing a parameter (like cost or demand probability) to see if the decision still holds—helping us judge whether the decision is robust.

## The basics of game theory

The basics of game theory are about how to **make optimal strategic choices in environments where multiple decision-makers influence each other.** 

- For example, two airlines simultaneously decide whether to lower prices—each one’s choice affects the other’s profits. We studied classic models in “non-cooperative games,” such as the “prisoner’s dilemma.” In this model, two suspects are interrogated separately. If both remain silent (cooperate), each gets 1 year in prison. If one betrays the other, the betrayer goes free while the silent one gets 10 years. If both betray, each gets 8 years. From a collective perspective, mutual silence is best, but from individual rationality, each person chooses to betray because, no matter what the other does, betrayal leads to a lighter punishment. This shows that, without trust or communication, individual rationality can lead to collectively suboptimal outcomes. 

We also learned about “**Nash equilibrium**,” which is a state where, in a set of strategies, no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy. In the prisoner’s dilemma, both betraying is a Nash equilibrium. This theory helps us understand strategic interactions in competition, such as price wars and advertising battles, and inspires us to think about how to encourage cooperation through mechanism design (e.g., contracts, rules).
