In this course, I mainly studied Linear Programming, Integer Programming, Transportation and Assignment Problems, and Dynamic Programming. These topics form the core of Management Operations Research, **which helps us use mathematical and computational tools to solve real-world managerial decision-making problems**. 

For example, how a company can make the best production plan under limited resources, how to design an optimal logistics distribution strategy, or when and how much to order to save costs. Although it's a bilingual course, our teachers used many practical examples to help us understand abstract models, and also taught us to use software like LINDO and Excel to solve these problems, making the theories truly applicable in practice.

## Linear Programming

Linear Programming **is mainly used to find the best possible solution**—<u>such as maximizing profit or minimizing cost—when there are multiple constraints</u>. 

- For example, suppose a factory produces two products, A and B. Each unit of A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 kilograms of raw material, while each unit of B requires 4 hours of labor and 2 kilograms of raw material. The factory has a maximum of 100 labor hours and 90 kilograms of raw material available per day. If selling one unit of A earns 50 yuan and one unit of B earns 70 yuan, how many units of A and B should be produced each day to maximize profit? 

- This problem can be modeled using Linear Programming. We define the quantities of A and B as two variables, x1 and x2. The goal is to maximize total profit: 50x1 + 70x2, subject to the labor constraint: 2x1 + 4x2 ≤ 100, the material constraint: 3x1 + 2x2 ≤ 90, and non-negativity: x1 ≥ 0, x2 ≥ 0. By graphing or using the Simplex Method, we can calculate the optimal solution. 

We also learned **Sensitivity Analysis**, which helps us understand what happens if conditions change—like if the price of raw materials goes up, will the best plan change? The Shadow Price tells us how much profit would increase if we had one more kilogram of raw material. This is very useful for managers when making purchasing decisions.

## Integer Programming

Integer Programming is an extension of Linear Programming, but **it requires some or all variables to take integer values**. This is very common in real life because you can't produce "half a machine" or "0.7 employees." 

For example, a company needs to decide in which cities to build warehouses. Each city either builds one (value = 1) or doesn't (value = 0). This is called 0-1 Integer Programming. We learned a method called the Branch-and-Bound Method. Suppose there are three candidate cities, each with different construction costs and customer coverage. The goal is to cover all customers with the lowest total cost. First, we relax the integer constraints and solve it as a regular linear program, which might give a fractional solution—like building 0.6 of a warehouse in one city, which is impossible. Then we "branch" by forcing that variable to be ≤0 or ≥1, creating two sub-problems. We solve each, and keep "bounding" by eliminating branches that can't lead to a better solution than the current best. We **repeat this until we find the optimal combination of 0s and 1s**. We also did computer lab exercises using LINDO software. After inputting the model, the software gave the optimal result in seconds, which was very efficient.

## Transportation and Assignment Problems

Transportation and Assignment Problems are two special and important network optimization models. 

The **Transportation Problem** deals with how to ship goods from multiple supply points to multiple demand points at the lowest total cost. 

- For example, suppose there are three factories (A, B, C) that can supply 50, 60, and 70 tons of goods respectively, and four cities (Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding) that need 40, 50, 30, and 60 tons respectively. The shipping cost per ton from each factory to each city is different—say, 3 yuan/ton from A to Jia, 5 yuan/ton from B to Ding, and so on. Our goal is to design a shipping plan that meets all demands at the lowest total cost. We learned methods like the Tableau Method and the Transportation Simplex Method to solve this. 

The **Assignment Problem** is a special case. For example, there are four workers and four tasks, and each worker takes a different amount of time to complete each task. How should we assign one task to each worker so that the total time is minimized? This can be quickly solved using the Hungarian Method. 

- In class, we worked on an example: Worker Xiao Li takes 2 hours to fix a car and 5 hours to write a program; Xiao Wang takes 3 hours to fix a car and 4 hours to write a program. By calculating, we found that assigning Xiao Li to fix the car and Xiao Wang to write the program gives the shortest total time—only 6 hours, saving 1 hour compared to the reverse assignment.

## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a method for **solving multi-stage decision problems**, especially suitable when today’s decisions affect future options. 

Its core idea is "**breaking a big problem into smaller ones and solving them backward**." 

For example, consider a machine replacement problem: A company has a machine that can be used for up to 5 years. At the beginning of each year, they must decide whether to keep the old machine or replace it with a new one. The maintenance cost of the old machine increases every year—say, 10,000 yuan in year 1, 20,000 in year 2, up to 50,000 in year 5. Replacing the machine costs 80,000 yuan, but then the maintenance cost resets to 10,000 yuan in the first year of the new machine. The goal is to minimize total cost over 5 years. Dynamic Programming starts from year 5 and works backward: Suppose it’s the beginning of year 5. If we keep the old machine, the cost is just the maintenance fee for that year. If we replace it, the cost is 80,000 + 10,000. Then we move back to year 4, considering the best choice under different conditions, and step by step figure out the optimal strategy from year 1. We also learned how to model and solve this using spreadsheets (Excel), listing the state, decision, and cost for each year, which made it very clear and visual.
