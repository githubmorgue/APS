In this course, I mainly studied the fundamental theories and strategic applications of management information systems, enterprise-level key systems such as supply chain management and customer relationship management, database and business intelligence technologies, methods for developing information systems, and ethical and security issues in information technology. 

These topics helped me understand how information technology can be systematically applied in business management to improve efficiency, optimize decision-making, and create competitive advantages.

## How to gain competitive advantage

A is about how management information systems help businesses gain competitive advantage, especially through Porter’s Five Forces Model and the Three Generic Strategies to analyze the industry’s competitive environment and formulate IT-supported strategies. 

For example, in the retail industry, companies are affected by five forces: bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, threat of new entrants, threat of substitutes, and rivalry among existing competitors. 

We used **Porter’s Five Forces** to analyze how e-commerce platforms like JD.com weaken the bargaining power of both suppliers and customers through information systems. 

- For instance, by building a large supplier database and automated procurement systems, JD can quickly compare prices and delivery times from different suppliers, choose the best partners, and reduce reliance on any single supplier. 

At the same time, it uses user behavior data analysis and personalized recommendation systems to increase customer loyalty, making it harder for buyers to switch to other platforms. We also studied Porter’s **Three Generic Strategies**: cost leadership, differentiation, and focus. 

- For example, Walmart uses its global supply chain information system to achieve extremely high logistics efficiency, significantly reducing operational costs—this is a classic cost leadership strategy. In contrast, Nike uses CRM systems to collect user preference data and offers customized sneakers, following a differentiation strategy. This course taught me that information systems are not isolated technical tools; they must be closely integrated with business strategy to deliver maximum value.

## Key Information Systems

Supply Chain Management (SCM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, these systems are like the "nervous system" of a company, connecting different departments such as procurement, production, sales, finance, and human resources, enabling real-time information sharing and collaborative work. 

For example, we analyzed Procter & Gamble’s (P&G) SCM system. When shampoo sales increase at a Walmart store, this sales data is automatically uploaded from the POS (Point of Sale) system to Walmart’s central database, and then transmitted in real time to P&G via EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) technology. <u>Upon receiving the order, P&G’s production system automatically adjusts its production schedule and arranges shipment—almost without human intervention.</u> This is how an **SCM** system enables "demand-pull production," avoiding overstock or stockouts. 

A **CRM** system, like Salesforce, <u>helps companies manage customer information, sales leads, and after-sales service.</u> 

- For instance, an insurance company <u>uses a CRM to record each customer’s policy details, communication history, and complaint records. When a customer calls, the service agent can instantly pull up the full profile and provide personalized service.</u> 

Finally, **ERP** systems, such as SAP or Yonyou, integrate all these subsystems—SCM, CRM, finance, HR—into a single unified platform. It’s like a “central brain” where all departments use the same data, eliminating “information silos.” 

- For example, when the sales department closes a big deal, the finance department immediately sees the accounts receivable, and the production department can instantly plan manufacturing. In class, we discussed that without an ERP, if each department uses separate Excel files or outdated systems, data inconsistencies arise, communication is inefficient, and errors are common. Therefore, these key systems are the foundation of efficient operations in modern enterprises.

## Databases and Business Intelligence

Simply put, a **database** is like a highly organized electronic filing cabinet used to store and manage various business data, such as customer information, order records, and inventory levels. We focused on the relational database model, which organizes data into tables. 

- For example, a “Customer” table has fields like Customer ID, Name, and Phone, while an “Order” table has Order Number, Customer ID, and Amount. By linking these tables through the common “Customer ID” field, we can easily find all orders placed by a specific customer. 

A Database Management System (**DBMS**), such as MySQL or Oracle, is the software used to operate these databases, allowing fast querying, updating, and deletion of data. But having data isn’t enough—businesses need to extract value from it. 

This leads to **data warehouses and [data mining](13-Data Mining.md)**. 

A data warehouse is <u>a large database designed specifically for analysis</u>, integrating historical data from different departments (e.g., sales, finance, production), cleaning it, and storing it. 

- For example, a supermarket chain might generate hundreds of thousands of transaction records daily, which are regularly imported into a data warehouse. 

Then, using **data mining** techniques like clustering or association rules, <u>hidden patterns are discovered</u>. 

- A classic example is the “**beer and diapers**” case: retailers found that men buying diapers on weekend evenings were highly likely to also buy beer. By placing beer next to diapers during promotions, sales increased significantly. 

This process of <u>extracting insights from data to support decisions</u> is called **business intelligence**. This course taught me that data is the “oil” of the new era, but it must be “refined” through processing and analysis to become useful “fuel.”

> In simple terms, a **database** is like a real-time operational filing cabinet, while a **data warehouse** is more like a historical archive designed for analysis.
>
> A **database**, especially a relational one, is used for **daily business operations**. It stores current, transactional data—like recording a new customer order, updating inventory, or processing a payment. It's optimized for speed and accuracy in handling frequent, small-scale read and write operations.

> In contrast, a **data warehouse** is not used for daily transactions. Instead, **it collects large volumes of historical data from multiple sources**—such as sales databases, customer service logs, and financial systems—over weeks, months, or years. **This data is cleaned, integrated, and stored in a way that supports complex queries and business analysis**.

>
> So, while a database answers questions like *"What was the status of order #12345?"*, a data warehouse answers *"Which products sold best in the north region during summer 2023, and how did marketing campaigns affect that?"* In short: databases support daily operations; data warehouses support strategic decision-making through historical analysis.

## Develope and Manage Information Systems

We learned that developing an information system isn’t something done overnight, but a process with clear stages. 

**Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** has five phases: planning, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance. 

- For example, if a bank wants to develop a new mobile banking app, in the planning phase, it sets project goals and budget; in the analysis phase, it investigates user needs—such as faster money transfers or bill checking; in the design phase, it creates interface mockups and database structures; in implementation, programmers write code and test the system; finally, after launch, it enters the maintenance phase, fixing bugs and updating features. 

However, traditional SDLC can be time-consuming, so we also studied **prototyping**—building a simplified version of the system (a prototype) quickly, letting users try it and give feedback, then improving it iteratively. 

- For instance, when developing an inventory management system, you might start with a basic version that only allows inputting and querying inventory. After warehouse staff test it, they might say, “We need an alert function.” The team then adds a feature that automatically warns when inventory falls below a threshold. This approach is more flexible and better meets real user needs. 

Additionally, companies don’t always build systems in-house—they can **outsource development** to specialized firms, like Tata in India or Huawei in China. We discussed the pros and cons of outsourcing: <u>benefits include cost savings and access to external expertise, while drawbacks include potential loss of control, communication challenges, or data security risks</u>. This knowledge taught me that the success of an information system depends not just on technology, but also on the management of the development process and user involvement.

## Ethics, Privacy, and Security in Information Technology

As companies become increasingly dependent on information systems, the risks of data breaches, cyberattacks, and privacy violations also grow. We studied three core issues. 

First is **ethics**—should a company use algorithms to monitor employee productivity? If overdone, it might violate employee dignity. 

Second is **privacy**—e-commerce platforms collect users’ browsing history, purchase records, and even location data. If misused, such as selling to third parties for targeted ads, it can violate user privacy. The EU’s GDPR regulation strictly limits such practices, requiring companies to obtain explicit user consent before collecting data. 

Third is **security**—how to prevent hackers from breaking into systems and stealing customer information. We learned several security measures: firewalls act like electronic walls, blocking unauthorized access; encryption turns data into unreadable code—even if stolen, it can’t be understood, like how online banks use SSL encryption when transmitting passwords; and two-factor authentication (2FA) requires both a password and a phone verification code, greatly enhancing security. 

We analyzed a real case: in 2017, the U.S. credit rating agency Equifax suffered a hacker attack due to a system vulnerability, exposing personal data of 147 million users, including Social Security numbers and credit card information. The company’s stock price plummeted, and its reputation was severely damaged. This case taught me that information security isn’t just a technical issue—it’s critical to the survival of the entire enterprise.
