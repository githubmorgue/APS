In this course, I mainly studied the basic architecture and module integration of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, the logic and application of Material Requirements Planning (MRP), the formulation and optimization of Master Production Schedule (MPS), the evaluation methods of Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP), and the fundamental concepts of supply chain integration management. 

These topics form the core framework of the ERP course, helping me understand how a manufacturing company can achieve efficient resource coordination and digital process management through information systems. 

## The basic architecture and module integration

In this course, I mainly learned about the basic architecture of ERP systems and how different modules are integrated. An ERP system is like the "central nervous system" of a company—it connects data and processes from departments such as finance, procurement, production, inventory, and sales, eliminating information silos. 

- For example, in a traditional manual system, if the sales team gets an order, they might have to call the production team, who then checks inventory and contacts procurement. This process is slow and error-prone. But in an ERP system—like SAP or Yonyou—once a sales order is entered, **the system automatically triggers a series of actions**: it checks whether inventory is sufficient; if not, it generates purchase suggestions or production tasks, and the finance module updates accounts receivable accordingly. In class, we used a simulation case: a bicycle factory receives an order for 100 mountain bikes. 

The ERP system instantly shows the current inventory levels of key components like frames, tires, and gear shifters. If any part is missing, the system automatically alerts the procurement team to place an order. This integrated design ensures all departments work from the same real-time data, greatly improving efficiency and accuracy.

## Material Requirements Planning

Material Requirements Planning (MRP), whose purpose is to **precisely calculate the quantity and timing of raw materials and components that need to be purchased or produced, based on customer orders and product structure.** Simply put, MRP answers three questions: <u>What do we need to make? What materials are required? And when do we need them?</u> 

- Let’s continue with the bicycle factory example: one mountain bike consists of one frame, two tires, one gear set, etc. This structure is called the **Bill of Materials (BOM)**. If the customer orders 100 bikes, <u>the MRP system uses the BOM to automatically calculate</u> that it needs 100 frames, 200 tires, and 100 gear sets. Then the system checks current inventory. Suppose there are only 80 frames in stock—the system will suggest purchasing 20 more frames. 
- It then considers **the procurement lead time** (e.g., the supplier needs 7 days to deliver) and calculates backward to determine the latest order date. For instance, if today is October 1, the purchase order must be placed by October 1 to ensure delivery by October 8, so production won’t be delayed. This prevents both overstocking (which wastes money) and stockouts (which halt production).

## Master Production Schedule

Master Production Schedule (MPS), which can be seen as the "commander-in-chief" of the entire production system. It **decides which finished products the company will produce**, how many, and when, over a specific future period—say, the next 8 weeks. **The inputs to MPS come from sales forecasts and actual customer orders, and its output is a detailed production schedule.** 

- For example, the sales team at the bicycle factory forecasts 300 mountain bikes and 200 road bikes in demand next month. 

The MPS must combine this information with the factory’s production capacity to create a weekly production plan. 

- Suppose the factory can produce a maximum of 80 bikes per week. The MPS might then schedule: Week 1 – 50 mountain bikes and 30 road bikes; Week 2 – 60 mountain bikes and 20 road bikes, and so on. 

- In class, we ran a simulation in Excel and found that if the MPS is poorly planned—say, <u>producing only mountain bikes in the first two weeks and delaying road bikes until later—it could lead to late delivery of road bike orders and unhappy customers.</u> 

Therefore, the MPS must **balance demand, production capacity, order priority, and delivery deadlines to maintain a steady production rhythm and avoid situations where the factory is either overwhelmed or underutilized**.

## Capacity Requirements Planning

The purpose of CRP is to **check whether the plans from MPS and MRP are actually feasible—specifically, whether the factory has enough labor, machines, and working hours to complete the production tasks**. 

- For example, producing one mountain bike requires 2 hours in the welding shop and 1.5 hours in the painting shop. If the MPS plans to produce 100 mountain bikes next week, the welding shop will need 200 hours of work (100 × 2). Suppose the shop has 5 workers, each working 40 hours per week—total available capacity is 200 hours. That matches perfectly. But if the MPS plans to produce 120 bikes, it would require 240 hours, exceeding the available 200 hours. 

This creates a "capacity bottleneck." CRP is used to identify such issues in advance. In class exercises, we found that if we only look at MRP’s material plan, we might overlook the actual capacity of the workshops, leading to unrealistic plans. So **CRP acts like a "stress test," ensuring that the production plan isn’t just theoretical but can actually be executed in reality.**

## Supply Chain Integration Management

An ERP system doesn’t just manage internal processes—it can also **connect with external suppliers and customers’ systems to enable supply chain collaboration.** 

For example, the bicycle factory can share inventory levels and demand forecasts with its tire supplier. When the factory’s MRP system detects that tire inventory falls below a safety level (say, fewer than 100), it can **automatically send an electronic purchase order to the supplier’s system via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)**. The supplier then ships the tires immediately. 

We analyzed a real-world case: Volkswagen uses a similar system, allowing thousands of suppliers to see production plans in real time. Parts arrive at the assembly line exactly when needed, <u>enabling Just-in-Time (JIT) production</u>. **This way, the factory doesn’t need to stockpile large amounts of inventory, saving on warehousing costs.** We did a calculation: if a factory’s annual inventory cost is 15% of sales, integrating ERP with the supply chain could reduce it to 8%, saving millions of RMB per year. Therefore, ERP is not just an internal management tool—it’s a bridge that connects the entire supply chain.
