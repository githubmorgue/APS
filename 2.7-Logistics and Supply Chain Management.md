In this course, I mainly studied the basic structure and design of supply chains, Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI), integrated supply chain management, and the issue of uncertainty and the "bullwhip effect" in supply chains. 

These topics not only form the core logic behind efficient modern business operations but also helped me understand how companies collaborate under globalized conditions to reduce costs and improve responsiveness.

## The construction of supply chains

Simply put, a supply chain is the entire network process that **starts with raw materials, goes through manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, and finally delivers products into consumers’ hands**. 

For example, in the case of Meditech Medical Devices Company mentioned in the syllabus: their medical equipment requires many components sourced from suppliers in different countries, which are then assembled and shipped via regional warehouses to hospitals. If this chain is poorly designed — for instance, if a critical component runs out of stock or the shipping route is too indirect — it could delay the delivery of the entire device, affecting patient care. 

Therefore, in class, we learned how to design different supply chain structures based on product characteristics — such as whether it's a **functional product like bottled water** or an **innovative product like a high-end custom jeweler**. For functional products, companies focus more on cost control and stable supply, so they use a "**push-based**" supply chain, producing goods based on forecasts ahead of time. In contrast, for innovative products with uncertain demand, a "**pull-based**" supply chain works better, where production and distribution only start after actual customer orders come in. This product-driven strategy for supply chain design helps companies meet customer needs while avoiding excessive inventory buildup.

The main difference between a "push-based" and a "pull-based" supply chain lies in *when* and *why* products are made and moved through the system. In a **push system, production and distribution decisions are based on forecasts** — essentially, companies try to predict what customers will want in the future and then "push" the products toward the market ahead of time. In contrast, a **pull system is driven by actual customer demand** — products are only made or shipped *after* a real order is placed, so the demand "pulls" the product through the chain.

## Vendor Managed Inventory

Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI), which is a collaborative mechanism that changes the traditional procurement model. In the past, retailers decided when and how much to reorder themselves, but often over-ordered due to delayed information or fear of stockouts, leading to inventory waste. With VMI, the decision-making power shifts to the upstream supplier. 

For example, in the classroom case study of Kimberly-Clark managing toilet paper inventory for Costco stores, Kimberly-Clark can directly access Costco’s sales data. When the system shows that a particular store is running low on toilet paper, they automatically arrange replenishment without waiting for Costco to place an order. The benefit is a significant reduction in information delays and distortions, lowering overall inventory levels. I remember our teacher did a calculation: after implementing VMI, inventory for certain product categories could drop by more than 30%, while service levels (the probability that a product is available when a customer wants to buy it) actually improved by around 15%. This shows that VMI doesn’t just save money — it also makes customers happier. Of course, this model requires high levels of trust and technical support, such as shared information systems and clear supply contracts defining responsibilities and profit-sharing.

## Integrated Supply Chain Management

Integrated supply chain management, which emphasizes breaking down internal departmental silos within a company and achieving coordinated operations across the entire process. 

For example, in traditional management models, procurement, production, and sales often operate independently: procurement buys in bulk to get discounts, production runs long shifts for efficiency, and sales pushes promotions to meet targets — the result might be mountains of unsold inventory. But in integrated supply chain management, all stages must be planned around customer demand. Take Starbucks’ supply chain system: they combine weather data, store location, holidays, and other factors to predict how much coffee beans each store needs every day, and then use an Advanced Planning System (APS) to automatically generate procurement and delivery schedules. During our lab session, we even got hands-on experience with APS software — after entering some parameters, the system generated optimal transportation routes and restocking timetables within seconds. This kind of cross-functional, cross-company integration is precisely what distinguishes modern supply chain management from traditional logistics.

## Bullwhip Effect

Finally, I’d like to highlight the “bullwhip effect,” one of the most common issues in supply chains. To visualize it, imagine cracking a whip — a small movement at the handle creates a huge swing at the tip. In a supply chain, **a minor change in consumer demand can cause increasingly larger fluctuations in orders as you move up the chain.** 

For example, in the Sport Obermeyer skiwear case from the syllabus: customer demand for a certain color/style of ski jacket may only fluctuate by ±10% year to year, but retailers, wanting to avoid stockouts, might order 20% extra. Manufacturers, seeing a spike in orders, further increase production, so the factory’s output could end up fluctuating by ±50% or more. This leads to serious resource waste and excess inventory. We learned several solutions, including information sharing (e.g., using real-time POS sales data), shortening lead times, and adopting VMI. Through simulation exercises, I found that simply sharing real sales data across partners can reduce order fluctuations by over 40%. This phenomenon made me realize deeply that a supply chain isn't just about the physical flow of goods — it's a precise coordination of information flow and decision-making.
