In this course, I mainly studied the basic framework of financial accounting, the accounting equation and double-entry bookkeeping, the preparation and analysis of financial statements, cost behavior and cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, and variance analysis in managerial decision-making. 

These topics form the core knowledge system of accounting, helping me understand **how businesses record economic activities, present their financial status, and use accounting information to support management decisions.**

## The basic framework of financial accounting

The basic framework of financial accounting defines fundamental accounting assumptions and principles, such as the **accounting entity assumption**, **going concern assumption**, **accounting period**, and **monetary measurement**. 

- These may sound a bit abstract, but they are actually like setting the rules before playing basketball: for example, we assume this team is independent (accounting entity), the game will continue and won't suddenly disband (going concern), we keep score by quarters (accounting period), and all points are measured in the same unit—“points” (monetary measurement). 

With these rules, accounting information becomes consistent and comparable. 

- For instance, we don’t include the owner’s personal expenses in the company’s books—that’s the accounting entity in action. Even if a company faces difficulties, we still assume it will continue operating, so when valuing assets, we don’t immediately write them down—that’s the going concern assumption.

## Accounting Equation and Double-Entry Bookkeeping

In this course, I mainly studied the accounting equation and double-entry bookkeeping. 

The **accounting equation** is “**Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity**.” This is like a balance scale: <u>the left side represents the resources the company owns (assets), and the right side shows where those resources come from—some are borrowed (liabilities), and some come from shareholders’ investments or profits (owner’s equity).</u> Every business transaction must maintain this balance. 

- For example, if a company uses 100,000 yuan from its bank account to buy a machine, the bank deposit (an asset) decreases by 100,000 yuan, but the machine (also an asset) increases by 100,000 yuan. The total assets remain unchanged, so the equation still holds. 
- Another example: if the company takes a 500,000 yuan loan from a bank, the bank deposit (asset) increases by 500,000 yuan, and at the same time, the bank loan (liability) also increases by 500,000 yuan. Both sides of the equation increase equally, so the balance is maintained. 

**Double-entry bookkeeping** is based on this equation and requires that every transaction be recorded in at least two accounts—<u>one as a “debit” and one as a “credit,” with equal amounts</u>. 

- For instance, if the company sells goods and receives 10,000 yuan in cash, it must record a “debit of 10,000 yuan” in the “Cash” account (asset increases) and a “credit of 10,000 yuan” in the “Sales Revenue” account (revenue increases, which eventually increases owner’s equity). 

The benefit of this system is that it effectively prevents bookkeeping errors—like having two people supervising each other to ensure accuracy.

## Financial Statements

We focused on three major statements: **the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement**. 

**The balance sheet** is a “financial snapshot” at a specific point in time—for example, December 31, 2024—<u>showing what the company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and what’s left for shareholders (owner’s equity).</u> 

- For example, if a company has total assets of 5 million yuan and total liabilities of 3 million yuan, then owner’s equity is 2 million yuan. 

**The income statement** is more like a video, <u>showing how much money the company earned over a period</u> (e.g., the entire year of 2024). <u>It starts with operating revenue, subtracts cost of goods sold, selling expenses, administrative expenses, etc., to get operating profit, then adds or subtracts other income and expenses to arrive at net profit.</u> 

- For example, if a company has annual revenue of 8 million yuan, cost of 5 million yuan, and expenses of 2 million yuan, its operating profit is 1 million yuan. 

**The cash flow statement** focuses on the actual flow of “real money,” divided into three parts: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. 

- For example, receiving 5 million yuan in cash from selling products is a cash inflow from operating activities; spending 1 million yuan to buy equipment is a cash outflow from investing activities; borrowing 2 million yuan from a bank is a cash inflow from financing activities. 

These three statements are interconnected. 

- For instance, the net profit from the income statement flows into the retained earnings on the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement explains the reasons behind changes in cash on the balance sheet.

## Cost-Volume-Profit analysis

In this course, I mainly studied cost behavior and cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis. 

**Cost behavior** refers to <u>how costs change as business activity levels change</u>. We classify costs into **fixed costs, variable costs.** 

- Fixed costs are like rent—10,000 yuan per month, whether you produce 100 or 1,000 units, you still have to pay the same amount. 
- Variable costs are like raw materials—if each product uses 50 yuan of materials, the more you produce, the higher the total cost. 

Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) analysis studies the relationship between sales volume, costs, and profit. A key concept is the “**break-even point**,” which is <u>the sales volume where revenue exactly equals total costs, and profit is zero</u>. 

- For example, if a product sells for 100 yuan, has a variable cost of 50 yuan per unit, and monthly fixed costs of 20,000 yuan, then the contribution margin per unit is 50 yuan (100 - 50). The break-even point is 20,000 ÷ 50 = 400 units. This means you must sell at least 400 units to avoid a loss. 

This analysis is very useful for management decisions. For instance, if the company wants to make a 10,000 yuan profit, it needs to sell (20,000 + 10,000) ÷ 50 = 600 units. With this analysis, managers can forecast profits at different sales volumes and set sales targets and pricing strategies.
