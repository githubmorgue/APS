## Evaluate a company's financial health

In this course, I mainly studied the three core components of financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement, as well as how to use ratio analysis to evaluate a company's financial health. These three statements are like a company’s “medical report,” each showing from a different angle how well the company is performing. 

The balance sheet is like a “snapshot” – it records what the company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and how much belongs to the shareholders (equity) at a specific point in time. 

- For instance, if a company’s balance sheet on December 31, 2023 shows 10 million RMB in assets and 6 million RMB in liabilities, then its equity is 4 million RMB. This means that if the company sold all its assets and paid off its debts, the remaining 4 million RMB would belong to the shareholders. 

The income statement is more like a “video recording” – it shows how much money the company earned, how much it spent, and how much profit it made over a period of time, such as one quarter or one year. 

- For example, if a company had 8 million RMB in revenue in 2023 and total costs and expenses of 6 million RMB, its net profit would be 2 million RMB. 

The cash flow statement, on the other hand, focuses on the actual movement of cash – it tells us whether the company actually received money, not just what it shows on paper. 

- For instance, a company might show a profit of 1 million RMB on its income statement, but if customers haven’t paid yet, its actual cash could be decreasing. These three statements must be analyzed together to get a complete picture of a company’s financial situation.

## Financial Ratio Analysis

Next, I studied financial ratio analysis in depth, which is a key tool used to **“decode” financial statements**. We use these ratios to judge whether a company is profitable, whether it can pay its debts, and how efficiently it operates. 

**Gross profit margin** is a very important indicator, <u>calculated as (revenue minus cost of goods sold) divided by revenue</u>. 

- If a company has a gross margin of 40%, it means that for every 100 RMB of products sold, it keeps 40 RMB to cover other expenses and generate profit. 

Another commonly used ratio is the **current ratio**, which measures <u>a company’s short-term ability to pay its debts</u>. It is <u>calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities.</u> 

- For instance, if a company has 5 million RMB in current assets (such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory) and 2.5 million RMB in current liabilities (like accounts payable or short-term loans), its current ratio is 2. This is generally considered healthy, meaning it has enough short-term assets to cover its short-term obligations. 

Another key ratio is **Return on Equity (ROE)**, which equals <u>net profit divided by shareholders’ equity</u>. It measures <u>how efficiently the company generates returns for its shareholders.</u> 

- For example, if a company has a net profit of 2 million RMB and shareholders’ equity of 10 million RMB, its ROE is 20%, meaning it earns 0.2 RMB in profit for every 1 RMB of equity invested by shareholders. 

These ratios are like “financial thermometers” that help us quickly assess a company’s “health.”

## Trend Analysis and Peer Comparison

In addition, we learned how to conduct trend analysis and peer comparison, which are important methods to make financial data “come alive.” 

**Trend analysis** involves looking at a company’s financial data over several consecutive years. 

- For example, if we look at a company’s net profit over the past five years and see it grows by 10% each year, that suggests its profitability is steadily improving. But if the net profit declines for three years in a row, that’s a red flag. 

- For instance, I once analyzed a home appliance company and found that its revenue grew by an average of 15% per year from 2019 to 2021, but suddenly dropped by 8% in 2022. This could be due to changes in market demand or increased competition, which would require further investigation. 

**Peer comparison** means putting a company side by side with its competitors. 

- For example, if two smartphone companies are compared and Company A has a gross margin of 30% while Company B has only 15%, we would wonder: Why does Company A earn more? Is it because of a stronger brand, higher pricing, or better cost control? 

Through such comparisons, we can clearly see where a company stands in the industry and what its advantages are. These analytical methods help us not only see “what is happening” but also think about “why it is happening.”

## Potential Risks

Finally, we also learned how to identify potential risks in financial statements, such as using the “DuPont Analysis” to break down ROE and find the root causes of changes in profitability. DuPont Analysis decomposes ROE into three parts: **net profit margin**, **asset turnover**, and **equity multiplier**. 

For example, if a company’s ROE drops from 15% to 10%, we can use this method to see which part is causing the problem. If the net profit margin falls from 10% to 5%, it means the company is earning less profit per yuan of sales, possibly due to rising costs or price competition. If asset turnover decreases, it means the company is using its assets less efficiently – for example, inventory is piling up or equipment is sitting idle. If the equity multiplier increases too much, it means the company has taken on too much debt, increasing financial risk. This kind of “layer-by-layer onion peeling” analysis allows us to deeply understand the operational issues behind the financial numbers. It’s like a doctor who doesn’t just check body temperature but also runs blood tests and CT scans to diagnose the real cause of illness.
