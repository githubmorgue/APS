In this course, I mainly studied five key areas: cross-cultural management theoretical frameworks, types of cultural conflicts in multinational corporations, the impact of cultural differences on organizational behavior, strategies for cross-cultural communication, and practical approaches to managing multicultural teams. 

These topics help me systematically understand the challenges that arise when employees from different cultural backgrounds work together in a multinational company, and how organizations can effectively address and manage these issues. 

## Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions Theory

The foundational part of the course is the cross-cultural management theoretical framework, with Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions Theory being the most central. This theory measures different national cultures across six dimensions. 

> “Power Distance” reflects how much people in a society accept unequal power distribution; 
> “Individualism vs. Collectivism” indicates whether people tend to act independently or prioritize group interests;
> “Uncertainty Avoidance” shows how comfortable people are with ambiguity and unpredictability. 

For instance, Germany scores high on “Uncertainty Avoidance,” meaning German employees prefer clear rules and detailed plans—like having every project step mapped out before starting. In contrast, countries like the United States score lower, where employees are more comfortable adjusting as they go. We applied this theory to analyze Shell’s operations in Nigeria: local communities emphasized collectivism and high power distance, but Shell initially communicated using Western-style individualism and low power distance, leading to a serious trust crisis and protests. This theory acts like a “cultural map” that helps us predict how employees from different countries might behave.

## cultural conflicts in multinational corporations

Next, we discussed common types of cultural conflicts in multinational corporations, focusing on three main categories: differences in communication styles, decision-making approaches, and perceptions of time. 

For example, both Germans and Japanese value efficiency and preparation in meetings, but their communication styles differ greatly. Germans are direct and straightforward—sometimes even “blunt”—and might say directly, “This part of your report is wrong.” In contrast, Japanese people place high value on “face” and indirect expression; even if they disagree, they might say, “This is an interesting idea” to politely decline. If a German manager works with a Japanese team, this difference can easily be misinterpreted as disrespect or insincerity. Another example is the perception of time, known as the difference between “monochronic” and “polychronic” cultures. Countries like Germany and Switzerland are monochronic: people prefer doing one thing at a time and strictly follow schedules—meetings start and end on time. In contrast, Latin American or Middle Eastern cultures are more polychronic: people may handle multiple tasks simultaneously and treat time more flexibly. We studied a case at IBM’s Argentina branch: the headquarters required all projects to follow a strict German-style timetable, but the local team was used to adapting flexibly to client needs. This led to headquarters viewing them as “unprofessional,” while local employees felt headquarters was “cold and impersonal,” ultimately harming project delivery efficiency.

## cultural differences on organizational behavior

The impact of cultural differences on organizational behavior is another key focus, especially in leadership styles and motivation systems. 

For example, in highly individualistic countries like the U.S., employees value personal achievement and public recognition—so programs like “Employee of the Month” work well. But in collectivist cultures like China or South Korea, publicly praising an individual might embarrass others or create resentment, as team harmony is prioritized. We analyzed Samsung Electronics’ experience setting up a factory in Vietnam: Korean managers used a high-intensity, directive leadership style, emphasizing obedience and efficiency. However, Vietnamese employees expected a more paternalistic and caring leadership style, wanting supervisors to act like elders who offer guidance and support. As a result, employee turnover reached 35% initially, far above the industry average of 15%. Later, the company adjusted its approach by introducing more team-building activities and informal communication channels, such as regular “tea talk sessions,” which gradually improved employee satisfaction. This shows that the same management method can have completely different outcomes across cultures.

## cross-cultural communication strategies

In the section on cross-cultural communication strategies, we learned how to reduce misunderstandings using “cultural brokers” and the concept of “high-context vs. low-context” communication. In high-context cultures (like Japan or China), people rely heavily on nonverbal cues and shared context—the message is often implied, not stated directly. In low-context cultures (like Germany or the USA), communication is explicit and relies on clear, direct language. 

For example, if a German engineer emails a Chinese colleague saying, “Please consider this suggestion,” it’s seen as polite in Germany, but the Chinese colleague might interpret it as a command due to its directness. Conversely, if the Chinese colleague replies, “We may need to study this further,” it’s a polite way to decline in Chinese culture, but Germans might interpret it as “there’s still a chance” and keep pushing forward, leading to confusion. To address this, many multinational companies appoint “cultural coordinators.” For instance, Siemens’ Shanghai branch trains employees fluent in both Chinese and German cultures to meet separately with both sides after project meetings, clarify intentions, and prevent conflicts from escalating.

## Cultural Intelligence

Finally, the practical part of managing multicultural teams emphasized the importance of “Cultural Intelligence” (CQ)—the ability to function effectively in culturally diverse settings. CQ includes three aspects: cognitive (understanding cultural differences), emotional (adapting to and respecting differences), and behavioral (adjusting communication and actions). 

We practiced this through a simulation: a German auto parts company collaborating with an Indian software firm to develop a smart driving system. The German team preferred detailed Gantt charts and three weekly progress meetings; the Indian team favored flexible Agile development with daily stand-ups. At first, each side complained the other was “too rigid” or “too casual.” Under the project manager’s guidance, they adopted a hybrid approach: using Gantt charts for milestones but Agile methods for execution, plus a “Culture Day” where both teams shared their work habits. In the end, the project finished two weeks early, with 98% client satisfaction. This case taught me that cross-cultural management isn’t about eliminating differences, but about learning to leverage them to create greater value.
