In this course, I mainly studied production planning and control, Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Master Production Schedule (MPS), Bill of Materials (BOM). 

These topics form the core framework of **modern manufacturing operations management**, helping me understand how a company starts from a customer order and systematically arranges production, purchases raw materials, organizes workshop processing, and finally delivers the product on time. 

## Production planning and control

Production planning and control focuses on how to **effectively schedule production activities to ensure that the right products are made at the right time, with the right resources, and in the right quantities.** 

- For example, if a bicycle factory receives an order for 100 mountain bikes, it can't wait until the last minute to buy tires, frames, gears, and other parts. Instead, it needs to plan ahead for each step. This requires a systematic method to predict what is needed, when it is needed, and how much is required. This course taught us to use scientific methods instead of relying on experience or "gut feeling" to make decisions, thereby reducing excess inventory and avoiding production delays.

## Bill of Materials

BOM, or Bill of Materials, is **the most fundamental tool for understanding what components make up a product**. 

- You can think of it as a "recipe" or "formula." For example, in our course project, we chose a small household fan as the product. This fan consists of a base, a motor, fan blades, a protective grille, and a control switch. The motor itself is made up of smaller parts like coils, a rotor, and a housing. 

The BOM lays out this structure layer by layer, like an upside-down tree: the finished fan is at the top, branching down into major components, which then further break down into smaller parts until reaching the smallest indivisible components. 

- In our design, this BOM had three levels and included about 25 different parts. With this BOM, we could clearly see exactly how many screws or how many meters of wire were needed to produce one fan, which laid the foundation for the subsequent material calculations.

## Master Production Schedule

Master Production Schedule (MPS) is like the "command center" of the entire production management system. 

It answers the question: What products will we produce, how many, and by when, over the coming period—say, the next 8 weeks? This plan isn't made up out of thin air; it's based on actual customer orders and market sales forecasts. 

- For example, in our course project, we assumed that the factory needs to deliver 50 fans in week 3, 80 in week 5, and 70 in week 7. The MPS breaks this down into weekly production targets—say, produce 30 units in week 1, 20 in week 2, 50 in week 3, and so on. This schedule becomes the foundation for all subsequent material purchasing and production scheduling. If the MPS is inaccurate—say, if demand is underestimated—it leads to stockouts; if overestimated, it results in excessive inventory, tying up capital. Therefore, creating a realistic and accurate MPS is the most critical step in production management.

## Material Requirements Planning

MRP (Material Requirements Planning) is a calculation system that determines exactly how much raw material and components need to be purchased or produced, based on the MPS and BOM. 

Its core question is: “In order to produce the final products on time, when and how much of the intermediate parts and raw materials do we need to purchase or produce?” 

- Continuing with the fan example, suppose we need to produce 50 fans in week 3, and each fan requires 1 motor, and each motor requires 200 meters of copper wire. If the warehouse currently has only 5,000 meters of copper wire, but producing 50 motors requires 10,000 meters, we have a shortage of 5,000 meters. The MRP system automatically calculates this gap and suggests that we place a purchase order in week 1, ensuring the copper wire arrives by week 2 or early week 3, so production isn't delayed. In our course project, we input the MPS and BOM data into an ERP software, and the system automatically generated a procurement plan and workshop production task list for the next 8 weeks—such as “Purchase 5,000 meters of copper wire in week 1” or “Produce 50 motors in week 2.” This process gave me a deep appreciation of how information systems automate complex calculations and significantly improve management efficiency.
