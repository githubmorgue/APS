In this course, I mainly learned about the fundamental concepts and design of databases, the creation and management of tables, the use of queries, the design of forms, and the generation of reports. 

This was a practice-oriented lab course where we used Microsoft Access, a database management tool from the Microsoft Office suite. Just as Excel is used for handling spreadsheet data, Access is designed to store, manage, and analyze large amounts of structured data in a more systematic way. 

Through this course, I learned how to build a small-scale database system from scratch—such as a student information management system or a library borrowing system—going far beyond simply filling out tables like in Excel.

## Database Fundamentals and Design

In the section on database fundamentals and design, we first learned what a "database" is and why we use databases instead of ordinary Excel spreadsheets. Simply put, a database is an organized collection of data that helps avoid duplication, ensures consistency, and supports fast searching and updating. 

For example, in a school, if every teacher uses Excel to record their class’s student information, a student who changes classes might have inconsistent records across different files. With a database, all information is centrally managed, so one update applies everywhere. We focused on the "Entity-Relationship Model" (ER Model), which uses diagrams to visually represent how data is related. For instance, in a library management system, "Book" is one entity, "Reader" is another, and they are connected through a "Borrowing" relationship. We drew these ER diagrams by hand and with software, then converted them into actual database structures. This process is like drawing architectural blueprints before building a house.

## Table Creation and Management

Next came table creation and management, which is the most fundamental and crucial part of a database. In Access, a "table" is similar to a worksheet in Excel, but more structured and standardized. We learned how to define fields—the column names and their data types. For example, in a "Student" table, we set up a "Student ID" field with a "Text" type and a length of 10 characters, such as "2023001001"; an "Age" field with a "Number" (Integer) type; and an "Enrollment Date" field with a "Date/Time" type formatted as "September 1, 2023". We also set a "Primary Key", which is like a person’s ID number—it uniquely identifies each record. For instance, the "Student ID" serves as the primary key in the student table, meaning it cannot be duplicated or left blank. We also learned about "data integrity" rules, such as setting a validation rule for the "Age" field as ">=16 and <=30". This means if someone enters 15, the system will pop up a warning, preventing incorrect data from being entered. It’s like installing a "security checkpoint" in the database to ensure only valid data gets through.

## Query

The use of queries was the most central and practical part of this course. A query is like a "search engine" for the database—it quickly retrieves the information we need from large amounts of data. We mainly learned about "select queries", which pull data from one or more tables based on specific conditions. 

For example, in an "order management system", we could create a query to find "customers who placed orders after October 2023 with an amount greater than 500 yuan". In Access, we used the "Query Design View": we dragged the relevant tables into the workspace, selected the fields to display—such as "Customer Name", "Order Date", and "Amount"—and then entered the conditions "> #2023-10-01#" and ">500" in the criteria rows. When we ran the query, the system returned all matching records. We also learned about "parameter queries", which are more flexible. For instance, the query could pop up a dialog box asking the user to input a date range, so we don’t have to manually change the criteria every time. This is just like searching for products on an e-commerce site—typing in keywords and a price range to get matching results automatically.

## Form Design

Form design makes the database much more user-friendly. If tables are the backend data storage, then forms are the frontend user interface—like the screens of a mobile app. We learned to use Access’s "Form Wizard" or "Design View" to create clean, easy-to-use input interfaces. 

For example, in an "employee information entry system", we designed a form with labeled text boxes for "Name", "Department", "Salary", and buttons like "Save" and "Clear". Users don’t need to deal with complex tables directly; they just fill in the form, click "Save", and the data is automatically stored in the backend table. We also added dropdown menus—for instance, the "Department" field used a dropdown list with options like "HR", "Finance", and "IT", which prevents typos or inconsistent entries. It’s like filling out a digital form, but more user-friendly and professional than a plain Excel sheet.

## Report Generation

Finally, report generation is the "output function" of the database. Reports organize data into formats suitable for printing or presentation, such as a monthly sales summary or a student transcript. We learned how to use the "Report Wizard" to select a data source (like the result of a query), then set up grouping and sorting. 

For example, in a "Student Grade Report", we grouped data by "Class", so each class’s results appeared in a separate section, and sorted within each group by "Total Score" in descending order. We also added calculated fields, such as automatically computing each student’s "Average Score" or the class average. Reports can be exported to PDF or printed directly, looking very professional—just like the official transcripts schools issue. It’s like turning raw data from the database into a polished "final product" for managers or teachers to review.
