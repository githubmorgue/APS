In this course, I mainly learned the basics of MATLAB operations and programming, numerical computing and matrix operations, data visualization, and writing scripts and functions to solve practical engineering problems. 

This is a lab-based course focused on hands-on practice, where we learn how to use MATLAB as a tool for data processing, modeling, and simulation through actual computer exercises. 

We had one lab session per week—our instructor would give a 20-minute lecture on key concepts, and then we’d work on assigned tasks ourselves, such as plotting a function, solving a system of equations, or simulating the behavior of a small system. Over the semester, I wrote more than 30 small scripts, starting from simple outputs like printing numbers, all the way to generating 3D surface plots and even creating a small animated simulation. The progress was very noticeable.

## Syntax

In terms of programming fundamentals, I learned MATLAB’s syntax, such as how to define variables, use loops (for and while loops), conditional statements (if-else), and how to organize a series of commands into a script file (.m file) that runs automatically. 

- For example, in one lab, we needed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100. Doing this by hand would be tedious, but we wrote a for loop: first define a variable sum = 0, then let i run from 1 to 100, and in each iteration add i to sum. When the loop finishes, sum holds the value 5050. That might sound like basic math, but the key point is that we learned how to make the computer automatically handle repetitive tasks. 

- Another example was checking whether a number is prime: we wrote a program where you input a number n, and the program uses a for loop to test division from 2 up to sqrt(n). If any number divides evenly, it concludes n is not prime. This kind of logical thinking laid the foundation for more complex projects later on.

## Numerical Computation and Matrix Operations

Numerical computation and matrix operations are the core of this course, because the name "MATLAB" actually stands for "Matrix Laboratory." We spent a lot of time learning how to create and manipulate matrices. 

- For instance, to define a 3x3 matrix A, you can write A = [1,2,3; 4,5,6; 7,8,9], where the semicolons indicate new rows. Then we can perform various operations on it, such as finding the inverse (using inv(A)), computing the determinant (using det(A)), or multiplying A by another matrix B. 

- A concrete example is solving a system of linear equations: suppose we have three equations: x + 2y + 3z = 6, 4x + 5y + 6z = 15, and 7x + 8y + 9z = 24. We can write the coefficients as a 3x3 matrix A, the right-hand constants as a column vector b, and then directly use the command x = A\b to solve for the values of x, y, and z. This backslash operator is unique to MATLAB—it uses efficient numerical algorithms behind the scenes, like Gaussian elimination, to quickly and stably compute the solution. This is extremely useful in engineering and management applications, such as supply chain optimization or traffic flow analysis, where such equation systems often appear.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization was the most fun part for me, because you can turn abstract numbers into intuitive images. We learned how to use the plot() function to draw 2D line graphs—for example, plotting y = sin(x) from 0 to 2π. We would set axis ranges, add titles and legends, and even change line colors and thickness. Going further, we also learned 3D plotting, using functions like mesh() or surf() to draw 3D surfaces. 

In one experiment, we simulated a mountain terrain, where x and y represent position, and z represents height, with the formula z = x^2 + y^2. We first used meshgrid() to generate grid points for x and y, computed the z value at each point, and finally used surf() to create a beautiful 3D parabolic surface that looked like a small hill. This kind of graph is also useful in management decisions—for instance, analyzing how different advertising budgets and pricing strategies affect sales, where a 3D plot can visually show the optimal combination.

## Functions

Finally, we learned how to write functions in MATLAB, which are different from scripts—functions can accept input parameters and return output values, similar to mathematical functions like f(x). 

For example, I wrote a function called myQuadraticSolver that takes three inputs: a, b, and c, representing the coefficients of a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, and returns the two roots. Inside, it uses the quadratic formula and includes a check: if the discriminant b² - 4ac is negative, it returns complex roots. So later, I can just call myQuadraticSolver(1, -5, 6), and it gives me the results 3 and 2. This modular programming approach allows us to break down complex problems into smaller parts, with each function handling one task, and the main program simply calling them. This is especially important in larger projects—for instance, in building an inventory management model, we can write separate functions for demand forecasting, cost calculation, and optimal order quantity, then combine them into a complete system.
