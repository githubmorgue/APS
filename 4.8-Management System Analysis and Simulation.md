In this course, I mainly learned the fundamental modeling methods in AnyLogic, agent-based modeling, discrete event simulation, system dynamics modeling, and database operations and data interaction within AnyLogic. 

These topics form the core of our experimental course on Management System Analysis and Simulation. The entire course was project-driven—we learned these techniques by building simulation models of real-world management scenarios, not just through lectures. Our instructor emphasized "learning by doing," so most of our time was spent working on computers using the AnyLogic software to build models, debug logic, and analyze results.

## Fundamentals

AnyLogic is a multimethod simulation platform, meaning it supports various modeling approaches—for example, we can use "agents" to simulate the behavior of individuals or companies, "flowcharts" to describe a factory’s production process, or "causal loop diagrams" to analyze how policy changes affect an economic system. 

At the beginning of the course, we first got familiar with the software interface, such as the model canvas, property panels, and experiment setup areas. Then we completed a small exercise: simulating the customer queuing process in a small coffee shop. We defined customers as "agents," each with their own attributes like arrival time, order preferences, and payment method. We also set up resources such as cashiers and baristas. By dragging and dropping process blocks—such as "Generate Agent," "Enter Queue," "Seize Resource," "Delay," and "Release Resource"—we constructed a simple service flow. After running the model, we could see an animation of customers moving through the system and also collect key metrics like average waiting time and server utilization. It’s like rebuilding a miniature coffee shop inside the computer, allowing us to "test-run" different management strategies—such as whether adding another cashier would reduce waiting time.

## Agent-Based Modeling

Next is agent-based modeling (ABM), in this method, **each individual in the system**—such as customers, employees, vehicles, or even companies—**is modeled as an independent "agent."** Each agent has its own rules, states, and behavioral logic. 

- For example, in a supermarket shopping simulation project we did, we modeled each customer as an agent. When a customer entered the store, they decided which shelves to visit based on their shopping list—some went to the fruit section first, others headed straight to frozen foods. 

We also **assigned different behavioral rules to each customer**: for instance, some would buy extra items if they saw a discount, while others would leave the store if the queue was too long. These behaviors were implemented using simple Java code or AnyLogic’s rule editor. 

- For example, we set a rule that if a customer waited more than 5 minutes at the checkout, there was a 30% chance they would leave without paying. 

Using this model, we could test how different promotional strategies or numbers of checkout counters affected overall sales and service quality. The advantage of this simulation method is that it captures individual differences and interactions, whereas traditional statistical methods often only look at averages and miss these nuances.

> In simple terms, **an agent is like a virtual person or entity in the computer that can make its own decisions based on rules we give it**. Think of it like a robot in a simulation—each agent has its own characteristics and behaviors. For example, in a supermarket simulation, each customer is an agent. One customer might always go straight to the dairy section, while another might first check for discounts. Each agent can react differently to the same situation—for instance, if there’s a long queue, one might wait, but another might leave immediately. We define these behaviors using simple logic or code in the software. So **instead of treating all customers as an average group, we simulate them individually**, which makes the model much more realistic. It’s like watching real people in a store, but inside a computer model.

## Discrete Event Simulation

The third part is discrete event simulation (DES), which is especially **suitable for systems with clear processes and limited resources**, such as hospitals, factories, or logistics centers. The core idea is that **the system state only changes at specific "events,"** such as "customer arrival," "service start," or "service end." In class, we worked on a simulation project of an emergency department. 

We used real hospital data: for example, on average, 8 patients arrived per hour, with 30% having minor conditions, 50% moderate, and 20% severe; there were 3 doctors and 5 nurses, and each patient required different diagnosis and treatment times. We used the "Generate" block to simulate patient arrivals at certain time intervals, the "Select Output" block to route patients to different examination rooms based on severity, and the "Seize Resource" block to model doctors and nurses being occupied. We also set priority rules: severe cases could jump the queue. Running this model, we found that even though average resource utilization was not high, serious congestion still occurred during peak hours due to the randomness of patient arrivals. We tested the effects of adding one more doctor or adjusting shift schedules and found that the latter was more effective in reducing pressure. This shows that simulation allows managers to predict the outcomes of different decisions without actually changing the real system.

> In Discrete Event Simulation, we **focus on the flow of entities**—like patients, products, or customers—through a process with fixed steps and limited resources. The system changes only at specific moments, called "events," such as when a customer arrives, starts service, or leaves. We model things like waiting times, resource utilization, and bottlenecks. For example, in a hospital emergency room simulation, we might track how long patients wait based on how many doctors are available. The key point is that the process is usually predefined, and the individuals (like patients) don’t make complex decisions—they follow a set path.
>
> In contrast, Agent-Based Modeling **focuses on individual entities**—called agents—who have their own rules, states, and decision-making abilities. Each agent can act independently and react to its environment or other agents. For example, in a supermarket model, each shopper is an agent who decides where to go, what to buy, or whether to leave if the line is too long. These behaviors are built into each agent, so the system’s overall behavior emerges from the interactions of many individuals.
>
> So, to summarize: **Discrete Event Simulation is great for analyzing structured processes with clear sequences** and resources, while **Agent-Based Modeling is better for capturing complex, dynamic behaviors** where individuals make independent choices. In our course, we used both—sometimes even combining them in one model—because real-world systems often need both perspectives.

## System Dynamics Modeling

The fourth topic is system dynamics modeling, which **focuses on the overall feedback structure and long-term trends of a system, rather than individual behaviors**. 

**It uses mathematical equations to model how entire groups or systems change, especially when there are feedback loops**. 

- For example, if a company increases advertising, more people buy the product, which increases revenue, allowing even more advertising—but eventually, the market gets saturated, and growth slows down. This kind of reinforcing and balancing feedback is shown using stock-and-flow diagrams. 

**System Dynamics shows how the whole system evolves over time due to internal structures and policies.**
