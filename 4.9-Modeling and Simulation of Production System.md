In this course, I mainly learned the basic operations of Flexsim simulation software, core concepts of discrete-event simulation, the process and methodology of production system modeling, resource scheduling and bottleneck analysis, as well as statistical analysis of simulation results and optimization recommendations. These components formed the main framework of this lab-based course, helping me build a solid understanding of digital simulation for modern manufacturing systems—from scratch—and develop hands-on skills.

This course is practice-oriented, meaning our goal wasn’t just to listen to lectures, but to actually build a virtual production line ourselves. We used this “digital twin” model to predict how a real-world factory would perform. 

## Fundamentals

Flexsim—a 3D visual simulation software that lets you drag and drop elements like conveyors, machines, workers, and forklifts into a virtual space, define their logic and rules, and then watch the whole system run—like building a miniature self-operating factory inside the computer. 

- For example, in one experiment, we simulated an electronic component assembly line with five stages: parts receiving, inspection, assembly, packaging, and shipping. 

We started by using the “Source” object in Flexsim to represent the raw material supply point, setting it to deliver a batch of 10 parts every 5 minutes. Then we used a “Queue” to act as a buffer zone where parts wait before processing. Next, we used “Processor” objects to simulate inspection and assembly machines, setting processing times—for instance, 2 minutes per part for inspection and 4 minutes for assembly. We connected these processes with “Conveyor” objects to represent physical conveyor belts. Finally, we used a “Sink” to represent the finished goods warehouse—once a product reaches the Sink, its journey is complete. In this way, we transformed a real-world physical process into a dynamic, runnable model on the computer.

## Discrete-Event Simulation

Let me now explain the concept of discrete-event simulation in more detail, as it’s the theoretical foundation of the entire course. Discrete-event simulation means that the state of a system only changes at specific points in time—it doesn’t change continuously. 

For example, in a factory, a machine is either “processing,” “idle,” or “broken down”—there’s no such thing as “half-processing.” Every time a part arrives, starts processing, finishes, or gets transported away, the system’s state jumps to a new value. This type of simulation is especially suitable for systems driven by a sequence of events, such as manufacturing lines, logistics networks, or hospital emergency rooms. In our assembly line model, every part arrival, every machine start and finish, counts as an “event.” Flexsim records these events in chronological order and calculates key performance indicators like waiting time at each station, machine utilization rates, and work-in-process inventory levels. For instance, after running the simulation for 8 hours, we found that the inspection machine had a utilization rate of 95%, while the assembly machine was only at 70%. This means the inspection station was almost always busy—likely becoming a bottleneck—and causing the downstream assembly machine to often sit idle. This leads directly to the next key topic: bottleneck analysis.

## Scheduling and Bottleneck Analysis

When it comes to resource scheduling and bottleneck analysis, we did very concrete exercises in class. A bottleneck is the slowest step in the entire process, and it determines the maximum output speed of the whole line—just like the narrowest part of a pipe limits the total water flow. 

In our model, using Flexsim’s “Chart” feature, we could observe the busy/idle status and queue length at each machine in real time. We noticed that the queue before the inspection station kept growing—sometimes piling up over 30 parts—while the area in front of the assembly station was often empty. This indicated that the upstream was feeding too fast while the downstream couldn’t keep up. To fix this, we tested two solutions: first, adding a second inspection machine to create a parallel dual-channel setup; second, adjusting the conveyor’s priority rule so that parts that had waited the longest would be processed first. We ran both improved models and compared the results. Adding the machine increased daily output from 160 units to 195, while changing the priority rule only brought it up to 175. In the end, we recommended the company prioritize adding equipment because the improvement was much more significant. This process gave me a deep understanding of how data can support management decisions.

## Optimization

Finally, we also learned how to conduct statistical analysis on simulation results and make optimization recommendations. Flexsim can automatically generate detailed reports—such as average waiting time per station, maximum queue length, resource utilization, and system throughput. But more importantly, we learned how to interpret what these numbers really mean. 

For example, if a machine’s utilization stays below 50% for long periods, it might be over-provisioned, and the company could consider reducing staff or equipment to cut costs. Conversely, if utilization exceeds 90%, it’s a red flag for potential bottlenecks. In another experiment, we simulated a warehouse distribution center and found that the forklifts’ average empty-travel rate was as high as 40%—meaning they were moving without carrying anything 40% of the time. By redesigning pickup routes and improving task scheduling logic, we reduced the empty-travel rate to just 18%, effectively allowing the same fleet to handle more transport tasks. This shows that simulation not only helps identify problems but also validates the effectiveness of improvement measures, enabling companies to make smarter investment and operational decisions.
