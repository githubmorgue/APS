In this course, I mainly learned about turning, milling, benchwork techniques, basic operation of CNC machines, and casting processes. These components formed the core practical modules of our metalworking internship, allowing me to gradually understand the fundamental procedures and technical aspects of modern mechanical manufacturing from scratch.

## Turning

Turning is the first major machining process I worked with during the internship. Simply put, turning is like using a fixed cutting tool to "shave" a rotating metal rod—similar to sharpening a pencil, but with steel instead of wood. We used a standard horizontal lathe, model CA6140, which is very common in Chinese technical schools and small workshops. Under the instructor’s guidance, I first learned how to properly install the workpiece—usually a cylindrical low-carbon steel bar, about 30 mm in diameter and 150 mm long. The workpiece is clamped into the lathe’s three-jaw chuck and then rotated at high speed by the spindle. The rotational speed varies depending on the operation: around 400 revolutions per minute (RPM) for roughing cuts, and up to 800 RPM for finishing to achieve a smoother surface. Next, I learned how to install different cutting tools—for example, an external turning tool for shaping the outer surface, and a parting tool for cutting the finished piece off the raw bar. I personally made a simple shaft-type part that required two stepped diameters, for example, reducing from Φ30 mm to Φ25 mm over a 50 mm length, while also ensuring the end face was flat and perpendicular. Throughout the process, I had to measure repeatedly using a vernier caliper to keep the dimensional error within ±0.1 mm. This experience gave me a deep appreciation for how strict precision requirements are in mechanical manufacturing.

## Milling

Milling is another crucial machining method, and it’s different from turning because in milling, the workpiece stays still while the rotating tool moves to cut away material. We used a vertical milling machine, model X5032, where the spindle is oriented vertically downward. The milling cutter is mounted on the spindle and has multiple cutting edges, resembling a spinning saw blade. One typical task I completed was machining a rectangular slot. We started with a rectangular steel block measuring 100 mm × 60 mm × 20 mm, and the goal was to mill a 40 mm × 20 mm × 5 mm rectangular groove into it. First, I securely clamped the workpiece in a vise mounted on the machine table. Then, I selected an appropriate three-side milling cutter with a diameter of about 20 mm. After starting the machine, the cutter rotated at high speed (around 600 RPM), and I manually turned the handwheel to slowly move the table, feeding the workpiece into the spinning cutter. This process required great care—the feed rate couldn’t be too fast, or it could damage the tool or result in a rough surface. I remember one time I fed too quickly, and the finished surface had visible ripples. The instructor pointed out this was due to "chatter" or vibration, indicating improper operation. In the end, I successfully completed the slot, using a depth gauge to confirm the depth was exactly 5 mm and checking that the side walls were perpendicular. This task helped me understand that milling is ideal for creating flat surfaces, slots, and keyways, while turning is better suited for parts with rotational symmetry.

## Benchwork

Benchwork, or "fitter work," might sound a bit "primitive," but it plays a vital role in the entire manufacturing process, especially in fitting and assembly tasks. Unlike machining, benchwork relies on hand tools to perform precise shaping and assembly. One of our most typical projects was to make a matching pair of square blocks using only files and hand saws. Each student received two similar metal pieces—mine were low-carbon steel blocks measuring 50 mm × 50 mm × 20 mm. The task was to file one piece into a precise square, say 40 mm × 40 mm, drill and tap threads into it, and then shape the second piece into a protruding boss that would fit perfectly into the first. It sounds simple, but it was actually extremely demanding in terms of patience and tactile skill. I used a flat file to carefully remove material from the edges, checking flatness with a straightedge and square after every few strokes, and measuring dimensions with a vernier caliper. To achieve the exact 40 mm size, I had to remove several millimeters of material, and the whole process took me nearly two full days. In the end, the two parts had to fit together perfectly, with a gap no larger than 0.05 mm—like a jigsaw puzzle. This project taught me that even in highly automated factories, manual fitting remains irreplaceable, especially during debugging and maintenance.

## Computer Numerical Control

Basic operation of CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines was introduced later in the internship and represents the direction of automation in modern manufacturing. We used an educational CNC lathe equipped with the GSK 980TA control system. Unlike manual lathes, CNC machines are controlled by programs written in a special language. I learned basic G-code commands: G00 for rapid movement, G01 for linear cutting, and G94 for facing cycles. My task was to machine a stepped shaft. The program went something like this: use G00 to quickly move the tool to the starting position, then use G01 to cut the outer diameter at a feed rate of 50 mm/min, followed by G94 to machine the end face, and finally use G00 to retract the tool. After writing the program, I simulated it on the machine to verify the tool path before clamping the workpiece for actual machining. During my first attempt, I forgot to include M30 (the program end command), causing the machine not to stop properly—luckily, the instructor caught the error in time. In the end, the part I produced had a dimensional accuracy of ±0.05 mm, which was even better than what I could achieve manually. This experience showed me that CNC technology not only improves efficiency but also greatly enhances consistency and precision in manufacturing.

## Casting

Casting was the most fun—and also the messiest—part of the entire internship, but it taught me how parts are literally "created from nothing." We practiced sand casting, a method where a mold cavity is formed in sand, and molten metal is poured into it. My project was to make a rough blank for a simple handle. First, the instructor gave us a wooden pattern shaped exactly like the final part. We placed it in a sand mold box, surrounded it with molding sand (a special sand mixed with clay and water), and compacted it with a rammer. Then, we carefully removed the wooden pattern, leaving behind a cavity in the shape of the part. We also carved out a pouring channel and a riser to allow molten metal to flow in and gases to escape. Next, in the foundry area, we heated cast iron in a furnace to about 1300°C until it turned into bright red, liquid metal. Using a ladle, we slowly poured the molten iron into the sand mold. After it cooled and solidified, we broke apart the sand mold and revealed a rough metal part. Although the surface was uneven, the basic shape was already formed. This process helped me understand that casting is one of the most cost-effective ways to produce complex-shaped parts in large quantities—for example, car engine blocks are made using similar principles.
