In this course, I mainly studied projection theory, three-view drawing, sectional views and cross-sectional views, dimensioning, as well as reading and drawing part drawings and assembly drawings. These five aspects form the core knowledge system of engineering drawing. This course is essentially the "language" of engineers. It teaches us how to use standardized drawings to accurately express the shape, structure, dimensions, and technical requirements of a mechanical part or device, ensuring that engineers and workers from different countries and factories can manufacture identical products from the same drawing. For example, we cannot just say "this part is a square block with a hole," but must use standardized views, lines, and symbols to clearly express all details such as length, width, height, hole position and size, surface smoothness, etc. It's like writing a manual that cannot have any ambiguity, but it is composed of graphics and symbols.

## Projection Theory

Projection theory is the foundation of the entire engineering drawing course. It explains how a 3D object is "projected" onto a 2D plane to form the drawings we see. We focused on orthographic projection, which assumes that light rays project parallel from the front, top, or left side of the object, and the shadow cast on a perpendicular projection plane becomes the view. This is like placing a part inside a transparent box: viewing from the front and drawing the outline on the front glass, viewing from the top and drawing on the top glass, and viewing from the left and drawing on the left glass. Then, unfolding and flattening these three glass panels gives us the front view, top view, and left-side view. Through extensive practice, such as drawing a rectangular block that is 10 cm long, 5 cm wide, and 8 cm high, we first draw the front view (a 10×8 rectangle), then the top view (a 10×5 rectangle), and finally the left-side view (a 5×8 rectangle), ensuring the correspondence between the three views—length alignment, height alignment, and equal width—to master the logic of converting from 3D space to 2D planes.

## Three-View Drawing

Three-view drawing is the practical application of projection theory. It requires us to accurately draw the front, top, and left-side views of a 3D object based on its description or model, or conversely, to imagine and complete the third view given two views. This is the most fundamental and important skill in engineering drawing. For example, in a classroom exercise, the teacher gave us a composite solid: a rectangular base measuring 8 cm × 6 cm × 3 cm, with a cylinder of 4 cm diameter and 5 cm height stacked exactly in the center on top. We first needed to determine the projection direction for the front view, usually choosing the direction that best reflects the object's shape characteristics, such as aligning the longer side of the rectangular base parallel to the projection plane. Then, the front view would show a rectangle 8 cm wide and 8 cm high (3+5), with a vertical line in the middle representing the projection of the cylinder; the top view would be an 8×6 rectangle with a 4 cm diameter circle inside; and the left-side view would be a rectangle 6 cm wide and 8 cm high, also with a vertical line in the middle. Through such exercises, we trained our spatial imagination and developed rigorous drafting habits.

## Sectional Views and Cross-Sectional Views

Sectional views and cross-sectional views are designed to solve the problem of complex internal structures being difficult to express clearly in three-view drawings. Imagine a part with internal holes, grooves, or cavities. If we only use solid and dashed lines to represent them, the drawing becomes very cluttered, and dashed lines can easily overlap with other lines, making them hard to see. At this point, we use the "imaginary cutting" method: like using a knife to cut the part in half, removing the half that blocks the view, and then drawing the projection of the remaining part. This type of drawing is called a sectional view. For example, consider a rectangular block 12 cm long, 6 cm wide, and 10 cm high, with a cylindrical through-hole of 3 cm diameter running along its length. If we draw a full sectional front view, we need to use a centerline (indicating the cutting plane position) passing through the center of the block, then draw the view after cutting: the external outline remains a 12×10 rectangle, but internally, instead of a dashed circle, there is a solid 3 cm diameter circle, clearly showing the existence and size of the hole. A cross-sectional view is even simpler; it only draws the shape of the cross-section where the cut is made. For instance, we only draw the 3 cm circle without the outline of the entire part, commonly used to represent the cross-sectional shape of shafts, rods, and similar parts.

## Dimensioning

Dimensioning is the "precise language" of engineering drawing. It specifies how to use numbers and symbols to indicate the actual size of a part on the drawing, and it is one of the most critical aspects that enable drawings to be used in actual manufacturing. A dimension typically consists of four parts: extension lines, dimension lines, arrows, and dimension figures. For example, to dimension the 8 cm length of the rectangular base mentioned earlier, we extend two extension lines from the left and right end faces of the base, draw a dimension line perpendicular to them, extending about 2 mm beyond the extension lines, with arrows at both ends and the number "80" (units in millimeters, usually not explicitly labeled) in the middle. We also learned different methods for dimensioning various features: for diameter, we add the "⌀" symbol, such as ⌀40; for radius, "R", such as R15; for angles, "°". More importantly, we learned the principles of "complete, clear, and reasonable" dimensioning—meaning all dimensions must be complete without omissions, arranged neatly without overlapping, and consider the measurement reference during machining. For instance, a stepped shaft has a total length of 100 mm, composed of three sections: the first section with a diameter of 20 mm and length of 30 mm, the second with a diameter of 25 mm and length of 40 mm, and the third with a diameter of 20 mm and length of 30 mm. When dimensioning, we would mark 30, 40, and 30 sequentially from one end, rather than just the total length of 100. This way, when a worker processes it on a lathe, they can measure and cut step by step, ensuring the accuracy of each section.
