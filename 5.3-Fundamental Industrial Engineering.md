In this course, I mainly studied work study, process analysis, work measurement, principles of motion economy, and the application of the Toyota Production System. 

These topics form the core of basic industrial engineering, helping us systematically understand how to scientifically analyze and optimize production processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. 

## Work study

Work study is the starting point of the entire course—it's like a doctor diagnosing a factory. We use systematic steps to observe a production process, identify where time, labor, or resources are wasted, and then propose improvements. This process has two parts: method study and work measurement. **Method study** looks at *how* something is done—like whether a worker’s process for assembling a part is reasonable. **Work measurement**, on the other hand, determines *how long* it should take under standard conditions. 

- For example, in a classroom experiment, we analyzed the operation flow of a small assembly line and found that workers had to frequently turn around to pick up screws from a box placed far away—this was an inefficient motion path. Through method study, we redesigned the tool layout. Then, using stopwatch time study (a work measurement technique), we recorded the time after improvement and reduced the assembly time per unit from 45 seconds to 32 seconds. This experience taught me that industrial engineering isn’t about making decisions based on intuition, but on data and systematic methods.

## Process analysis

Process analysis is a key tool in method study that helps us map out the entire production process from a macro perspective—like drawing a map so we can clearly see how materials, people, or information flow. We learned four main types of analysis charts: operation process charts, flow process charts, layout and route analysis, and administrative process analysis. The most commonly used is the flow process chart, which uses five standard symbols to represent different types of operations: for example, a circle stands for "operation," a square for "inspection," an arrow for "transportation," the letter "D" for "delay," and an inverted triangle for "storage." 

In one experiment, we analyzed the entire process of a part from raw material to finished product. We found that the part was moved 7 times, totaling 85 meters of travel, while the actual processing time was only 12 minutes—but the entire process took as long as 4 hours. The problem was the large amount of waiting time; for instance, the part waited nearly 2 hours in the quality inspection area due to queuing. With this flow process chart, we could immediately spot the bottleneck and suggested solutions like parallel inspection or adding more inspectors to reduce waiting time. This kind of visual method makes complex problems very intuitive—even someone unfamiliar with engineering can understand where the issues lie.

## Work measurement

Work measurement is the scientific method of determining "standard time"—that is, how long a qualified worker should take to complete a task under normal conditions. This time is crucial because it directly affects production planning, cost accounting, and performance evaluation. We learned three main methods: stopwatch time study, work sampling, and predetermined time standards (PTS). Stopwatch time study is like a referee timing athletes in a sports event—we use a stopwatch to measure each operation unit multiple times, remove outliers, and calculate the average time. But observed time alone isn’t enough—we also need "rating," which means judging whether the worker’s pace is fast or slow. 

For example, we define "normal pace" as 100 points; if a worker moves very quickly, we might rate them at 110 points, so the standard time is adjusted accordingly. We also learned work sampling, which doesn’t require continuous observation. Instead, we randomly check what the worker is doing at different times. For example, in 100 random observations, the worker was working 70 times, waiting 20 times, and chatting 10 times—this allows us to estimate the proportion of productive time. The most interesting method is predetermined time standards, such as the MODAPTS (MOD) system, which breaks human movements into basic units like "reach," "grasp," and "move." Each motion has a fixed time value, with the unit being 0.123 seconds (1 MOD). For example, reaching 20 cm takes about 4 MODs, or 0.492 seconds. By summing up all motion times, we can predict the standard time even before the worker starts the job. This method is especially useful during new product introduction, allowing standard times to be set without actual operation.

## The principles of motion economy

The principles of motion economy are a set of "golden rules" we follow during motion analysis, aiming to make every worker’s movement more efficient, less tiring, and safer. We learned 22 principles grouped into three categories, such as "both hands should start and end motions at the same time," "movements should follow smooth, curved paths rather than sudden direction changes," and "tools and materials should be placed in fixed locations close to the point of use." These may sound simple, but they are highly effective in practice. 

In one experiment, we observed a worker assembling a small plastic case using both hands. Originally, the right hand held a screwdriver, and the left hand picked up a screw from the table—a slow process. Applying motion economy principles, we redesigned the screw tray to be tilted so that screws automatically slid to the front, allowing the left hand to grab one instantly while the right hand was already ready with the screwdriver. This synchronized both hands, reduced idle time, and improved assembly efficiency by nearly 30%. This experience deeply impressed on me that industrial engineering improvements often don’t come from big machines, but from meticulous optimization of small details.

最后，我们通过一个真实案例学习了丰田式生产方式（TPS）在一汽的应用。TPS的核心是“准时化生产”（Just-in-Time）和“自动化”（Jidoka），也就是只在需要的时候生产需要的数量，同时赋予工人发现问题时停线的权利。在案例中，一汽通过引入TPS，把生产周期从原来的10天缩短到3天，库存减少了60%以上。他们使用了“看板”系统来传递生产指令，就像餐厅里的点菜单一样，下游工序用完零件后，就把看板卡送回上游，上游才开始生产。这种“拉动式”生产避免了过量生产造成的浪费。此外，他们还推行“持续改善”（Kaizen）文化，鼓励一线工人提出小改进建议，哪怕只是节省5秒钟的动作优化，也会被认真对待。这个案例让我明白，工业工程不仅是技术工具，更是一种管理哲学，它强调尊重员工、持续改进和消除浪费，这些理念在德国制造业中也同样被高度重视。

Finally, we studied a real-world case of the Toyota Production System (TPS) implemented at FAW (First Automobile Works). The core of TPS is "Just-in-Time" production and "Jidoka" (automation with a human touch)—producing only what is needed, when it is needed, and empowering workers to stop the line when problems are found. In the case, FAW reduced its production cycle from 10 days to just 3 days, and inventory dropped by over 60%. They used a "kanban" system to relay production instructions—like order slips in a restaurant: when a downstream process uses up parts, the kanban card is sent back to upstream, triggering new production. This "pull-based" system prevents overproduction and waste. Additionally, they promoted a "Kaizen" (continuous improvement) culture, encouraging frontline workers to submit small improvement suggestions—even saving 5 seconds in a motion could be recognized and implemented. This case taught me that industrial engineering is not just about technical tools, but also a management philosophy that emphasizes respect for people, continuous improvement, and waste elimination—values that are also highly respected in German manufacturing.
