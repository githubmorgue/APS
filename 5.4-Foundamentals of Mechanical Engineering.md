在这门课程中，我主要学习了机械制图、金属切削原理、典型金属切削机床与刀具、机床夹具设计原理以及机械加工工艺规程设计。这几部分内容构成了这门课的核心知识体系，帮助我建立起对机械制造过程的基本理解。机械制图是工程界的“语言”，它教会我们如何用图纸准确表达一个零件的形状、尺寸和技术要求；金属切削原理让我了解了刀具是如何从金属材料上去除多余部分的科学基础；典型机床与刀具部分则让我认识了工厂里常见的设备，比如车床、铣床这些“加工主力”；夹具设计讲的是如何把工件稳稳地固定在机床上，保证加工时不晃动；最后，工艺规程设计则是把整个加工过程像写剧本一样规划出来，确保生产又快又准。

In this course, I mainly studied mechanical drawing, metal cutting principles, typical metal cutting machines and tools, fixture design principles, and mechanical machining process planning. These components form the core of the course and helped me build a foundational understanding of the mechanical manufacturing process. Mechanical drawing is the "language" of engineering—it teaches us how to accurately express a part’s shape, dimensions, and technical requirements on paper. Metal cutting principles gave me insight into the science behind how a tool removes excess material from metal. The section on typical machines and tools introduced me to common factory equipment like lathes and milling machines—the "workhorses" of manufacturing. Fixture design explains how to securely hold a workpiece on a machine so it doesn’t move during processing. Finally, process planning is about organizing the entire machining sequence like writing a script, ensuring production is both fast and precise.

机械制图是这门课的起点，就像学外语要先学字母和语法一样。我们首先学习了国家标准规定的图幅、比例、字体和图线这些基本规范，比如A3图纸的大小是297mm×420mm，标题栏要画在右下角。然后我们重点学习了三视图的投影规律：主视图、俯视图和左视图之间的“长对正、高平齐、宽相等”关系。举个例子，如果一个零件是一个带孔的长方体，我们在主视图上看到的是长和高，在俯视图上看到的是长和宽，左视图则是高和宽。通过这三个视图的配合，就能完整还原出这个零件的立体形状。我们还学习了剖视图和断面图，比如当零件内部有孔或槽时，我们可以假想用一把刀把它切开，画出内部结构，这样就能清楚地表达那些看不见的细节。比如一个轴类零件，中间可能有通孔，如果不剖开，俯视图上就是一个圆，但剖开后就能看到孔的直径和深度，这对加工非常重要。

Mechanical drawing is the starting point of this course, just like learning the alphabet and grammar when studying a foreign language. We first learned the basic standards specified by national regulations—things like sheet sizes, scales, fonts, and line types. For example, an A3 drawing sheet is 297mm × 420mm, and the title block must be placed in the lower right corner. Then we focused on the projection rules of three-view drawings: the relationship between the front view, top view, and left-side view—what we call “aligned lengths, level heights, and equal widths.” For instance, if a part is a rectangular block with a hole, the front view shows its length and height, the top view shows length and width, and the side view shows height and width. By combining these three views, we can fully reconstruct the 3D shape of the part. We also studied sectional views and cross-sectional views. For example, when a part has internal holes or grooves, we can imagine slicing it open with a knife and drawing the internal structure. This way, we can clearly show details that are otherwise hidden. Take a shaft part with a through-hole in the middle—if we don’t cut it open, the top view would just show a circle. But once we use a sectional view, we can clearly see the hole’s diameter and depth, which is crucial for manufacturing.

金属切削原理这部分让我理解了加工过程中“刀”和“工件”之间到底发生了什么。比如在车床上加工一个圆柱形零件时，刀具是静止的，而工件高速旋转，刀具沿着工件表面移动，一层一层地切掉金属。这个过程中有三个关键参数：切削速度、进给量和切削深度。切削速度是指刀具切削点的线速度，比如加工普通钢件时，高速钢刀具的切削速度大约是30米/分钟，而硬质合金刀具可以达到100米/分钟以上。进给量是指工件每转一圈，刀具前进多少毫米，比如0.2mm/rev，这决定了加工表面的粗糙程度。切削深度则是单次切削去掉的材料厚度，比如2mm。我们还学习了刀具的角度，比如前角、后角，它们会影响切削的顺畅程度和刀具寿命。如果前角太大，刀具容易崩刃；太小又会增加切削力。这就像削铅笔——刀太钝削不动，太锋利又容易断。我们还了解了刀具磨损的过程，比如刀具用久了，刃口会变圆，这种现象叫“磨钝”，当磨损达到一定限度，比如后刀面磨损宽度达到0.3mm时，就需要更换刀具了。

The section on metal cutting principles helped me understand what actually happens between the cutting tool and the workpiece during machining. For example, when turning a cylindrical part on a lathe, the tool stays still while the workpiece spins at high speed, and the tool moves along the surface, removing metal layer by layer. There are three key parameters in this process: cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut. Cutting speed refers to the linear speed at the cutting point—for instance, when machining regular steel, a high-speed steel tool might run at about 30 meters per minute, while a carbide tool can exceed 100 meters per minute. Feed rate is how far the tool advances per revolution of the workpiece—say, 0.2 mm/rev—which affects the surface finish. Depth of cut is the thickness of material removed in one pass, such as 2 mm. We also studied tool angles, like rake angle and clearance angle, which affect how smoothly the cut proceeds and the tool’s lifespan. If the rake angle is too large, the tool edge can chip easily; if too small, cutting force increases. It’s like sharpening a pencil—too dull and it won’t cut, too sharp and it breaks. We also learned about tool wear—for example, after prolonged use, the cutting edge becomes rounded, a phenomenon called "blunting." When wear reaches a certain limit—say, the width of the worn area on the tool’s back face reaches 0.3 mm—the tool needs to be replaced.

我们还系统地学习了几种典型的金属切削机床，比如车床、铣床、钻床和磨床。车床主要用于加工旋转对称的零件，比如轴、盘、套类零件。我们重点分析了CA6140型卧式车床，它可以通过更换不同的刀具完成外圆、端面、螺纹甚至钻孔等多种加工。铣床则像“雕刻师”，它的刀具是旋转的，工件固定在工作台上移动。比如用立铣刀在一块金属板上铣出一个方形凹槽，刀具高速旋转，沿着预定路径走刀，就能精确地切出所需形状。我们还学习了钻床，比如Z3016型摇臂钻床，它的钻头只能做上下直线运动，适合打孔。而磨床使用的是砂轮，砂轮表面有无数细小的磨粒，像极细的砂纸，可以对零件进行高精度的表面加工，比如把一个轴的直径磨到精确的40.000±0.005mm，表面粗糙度达到Ra1.6μm以下。这些机床就像不同的“工具”，每种都有其专长，工程师需要根据零件的要求选择合适的设备。

We also systematically studied several typical metal cutting machines, such as lathes, milling machines, drilling machines, and grinders. Lathes are mainly used for machining rotationally symmetric parts, like shafts, disks, and sleeves. We focused on the CA6140 horizontal lathe, which can perform various operations—external turning, facing, threading, and even drilling—by changing tools. The milling machine is like a “sculptor”—its tool rotates while the workpiece moves on a fixed table. For example, using an end mill to cut a square groove into a metal plate: the tool spins at high speed and follows a programmed path to precisely shape the groove. We also studied drilling machines, like the Z3016 radial-arm drill, whose drill bit moves only vertically, making it ideal for hole-making. The grinder uses a grinding wheel covered with countless tiny abrasive grains—like ultra-fine sandpaper—capable of high-precision surface finishing. For instance, it can grind a shaft to an exact diameter of 40.000±0.005 mm with a surface roughness below Ra1.6 μm. These machines are like different “tools,” each with its own specialty, and engineers must choose the right one based on the part’s requirements.

夹具设计是保证加工精度的关键环节。想象一下，如果一个零件在机床上晃动，就像你写字时手不稳，字肯定歪歪扭扭。夹具的作用就是把工件牢牢固定在正确位置上。我们学习了“六点定位原理”，即用六个支承点来限制工件在空间中的六个自由度（上下、左右、前后移动和转动）。比如加工一个方形工件的上表面时，我们用三个支承钉贴住它的底面，限制Z方向移动和两个转动；再用两个支承钉挡住一个侧面，限制X方向移动和一个转动；最后用一个支承钉挡住另一个侧面，限制Y方向移动。这样工件就被完全定位了。我们还学习了夹紧机构，比如螺旋夹紧，就像拧螺丝一样把压板压下去，确保工件不会在切削力作用下移动。我们还看了车床三爪卡盘、铣床平口钳这些实际夹具，理解了它们是如何在真实生产中应用的。

Fixture design is a critical part of ensuring machining accuracy. Imagine trying to write neatly while your hand is shaking—the letters will be crooked. A fixture’s job is to hold the workpiece firmly in the correct position. We learned the “six-point locating principle,” which uses six support points to restrict the workpiece’s six degrees of freedom in space (movement and rotation along X, Y, Z axes). For example, when machining the top surface of a rectangular block, we place three support pins under its bottom surface to restrict movement in the Z direction and two rotational movements. Then we use two more pins against one side to restrict movement in the X direction and one rotation. Finally, one pin against the adjacent side restricts movement in the Y direction. This fully locates the workpiece. We also studied clamping mechanisms, like screw clamps, which work like tightening a bolt—the clamp plate presses down to prevent the workpiece from moving under cutting forces. We examined real-world fixtures like the three-jaw chuck on a lathe and the vise on a milling machine, understanding how they’re actually used in production.

最后，机械加工工艺规程设计是把前面所有知识整合起来的“顶层设计”。它就像是为制造一个零件编写一份详细的“操作手册”。比如我们要加工一个阶梯轴，首先要选择毛坯，可能是直径60mm的圆钢；然后规划工序：先在车床上粗车两端，调头精车，再铣键槽，最后磨削关键表面。每一步都要确定用什么机床、什么刀具、切削参数是多少，还要计算工序尺寸。比如最终轴径要求是Φ40h6（即40mm，公差-0.016mm），那么粗车可能留2mm余量，精车留0.5mm，磨削留0.1mm，一步步逼近目标。我们还学习了如何分析工艺成本，比如批量生产时用专用夹具虽然前期投入高，但单件加工时间短，总成本反而更低。这门课让我明白，制造不只是“动手”，更是一个需要系统规划、科学决策的过程。

Finally, mechanical machining process planning is the “top-level design” that integrates all the previous knowledge. It’s like writing a detailed “instruction manual” for manufacturing a part. For example, if we’re making a stepped shaft, we first select the raw material—perhaps a 60mm-diameter steel bar. Then we plan the sequence: rough turning both ends on a lathe, turning it around for finish turning, milling a keyway, and finally grinding critical surfaces. For each step, we decide which machine to use, which tool, what cutting parameters, and calculate the operation dimensions. For instance, if the final shaft diameter is Φ40h6 (40mm with a tolerance of -0.016mm), rough turning might leave 2mm of material, finish turning 0.5mm, and grinding 0.1mm, progressively approaching the target. We also learned how to analyze process costs—for example, using a dedicated fixture in mass production has high initial cost, but shorter machining time per piece, leading to lower total cost. This course taught me that manufacturing is not just about “hands-on work,” but a process that requires systematic planning and scientific decision-making.
