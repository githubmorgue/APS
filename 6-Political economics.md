In this course, I mainly studied the Labor Theory of Value, the Theory of Surplus Value, capitalist economic crises, the relationship between commodities and money, and the theory of social reproduction. These topics form the core framework of political economics, helping us understand the underlying logic of how market economies operate—especially from a Marxist perspective on resource allocation, wealth creation, and economic contradictions.

## The Labor Theory of Value

The Labor Theory of Value is the most fundamental and important concept in this course. It says that **the value of a commodity** isn’t determined by its price or how “useful” people think it is, but by the “socially necessary labor time” required to produce it. What does “socially necessary labor time” mean? Simply put, **it’s the average amount of time needed to produce something under current society’s average level of technology and labor intensity.** 

For example, suppose ordinary T-shirts sold in the market today take an average of 2 hours to produce in most factories using assembly lines. Then the value of such a T-shirt is roughly equivalent to 2 hours of socially necessary labor time. If a small workshop uses hand-stitching and takes 10 hours to make one shirt, they still can’t sell it for more, because consumers won’t pay extra for inefficiency. 

On the flip side, if a high-tech factory uses fully automated production and makes one shirt in just 1 hour, even though their actual labor input is less, they still sell it at the market price based on the 2-hour average—so they earn higher profits. This shows that value is determined by the social average, not individual cases. This theory helped me understand why companies are always trying to improve technology and efficiency: because the more efficient you are, the more profit you can make while selling at the same socially determined value.

## the Theory of Surplus Value

Next comes the Theory of Surplus Value, which is Marx’s **central explanation for where capitalist profit comes from**. Simply put, when workers do their jobs, the value they create is actually more than what they get paid in wages. The extra part—the difference—is called “surplus value,” and it’s taken by the capitalist as profit. 

- For instance, imagine a worker who works 8 hours a day. Their wage might represent the value produced in just 4 hours (meaning, after working 4 hours, they’ve already created enough value to cover their daily pay). But the employer requires them to work 8 hours. The value created in those additional 4 hours goes entirely to the company as profit, and the worker gets nothing for it. 

That’s where exploitation comes from. It sounds abstract, but it’s very common in real life. 

- Take Foxconn assembly line workers: they might earn 5,000 yuan per month, but each smartphone they help produce brings the company hundreds or even thousands of yuan in profit. A large portion of that profit comes from the surplus labor the workers perform beyond what’s needed to cover their own wages. 

This theory helped me understand that capitalist economic growth doesn’t come solely from **technological innovation or better management—it relies heavily on the surplus value extracted from workers’ labor**.

## the Theory of Capitalist Economic Crises

The third key topic is the theory of capitalist economic crises. Many people think economic crises happen due to poor management or external shocks like wars or pandemics. But Marx argued that capitalism itself contains internal contradictions that lead to periodic crises. One fundamental cause is “overproduction”—not that there are literally too many goods, but that too many people can’t afford to buy them. 

For example, factories keep producing smartphones, clothes, and appliances nonstop, but workers’ wages are limited, so their purchasing power can’t keep up with the pace of production. As a result, warehouses fill up with unsold goods, companies lose money, start laying off workers, unemployment rises, consumption drops further—a vicious cycle forms. The 2008 U.S. subprime mortgage crisis is a classic example: banks gave home loans to large numbers of low-income people, temporarily fueling a housing boom. But these borrowers couldn’t actually repay the loans, defaults piled up, the financial system collapsed, and a global recession followed. This shows that when most people earn too little to absorb the goods being produced, the economy runs into trouble. This theory made me realize that a healthy economy isn’t just about production—it also depends on fair distribution and whether ordinary people have enough purchasing power.

## Commodities and Money

I also learned about the relationship between commodities and money. In primitive societies, people used barter—like trading one sheep for five stone axes. But this was very inconvenient because you had to find someone who both wanted your sheep and had stone axes to offer. Over time, certain widely accepted goods—like gold or silver—became a “universal equivalent,” eventually evolving into money. Money is essentially a medium that makes exchange much easier. For example, for the laptop I’m using to write this paper, I don’t need to trade my essay directly with the chip manufacturer or my services with the assembly plant. Instead, I sell my research to a university or publisher, get money, and then use that money to buy the laptop. Money acts like a “lubricant,” making transactions across the entire economic system run smoothly. But Marx also warned that as money develops, people start to have illusions—that money itself *is* wealth, forgetting that it’s only a symbol of labor value. For instance, someone might have 1 million yuan saved in the bank and feel wealthy, but the real value of that money depends on society’s productive capacity. If all factories shut down tomorrow, that 1 million wouldn’t be able to buy a single bag of rice. So money isn’t wealth itself—it’s just a representation of wealth.

## the Theory of Social Reproduction

Finally, there’s the theory of social reproduction, which explains how the entire economy keeps running over time. Simply put, social production is divided into two main departments: Department I produces means of production—like machines, factories, and raw materials; Department II produces consumer goods—like food, clothing, and daily necessities. For the economy to function smoothly, these two sectors must stay balanced. For example, if the whole society produces 1 trillion yuan worth of means of production and 500 billion yuan worth of consumer goods this year, next year’s continued production depends on having enough consumer goods for workers and capitalists to live on, as well as enough means of production to replace old equipment and expand capacity. If we only focus on making consumer goods and neglect investment in machinery, steel, and other means of production, factories won’t be able to upgrade, and production will eventually stall. During China’s “Great Leap Forward” in the 1950s, there was an overemphasis on heavy industry, causing agriculture and light industry to fall far behind. People faced shortages of food and clothing, and the economy became unbalanced. Later, during the reform and opening-up period, the structure was adjusted, consumer goods production was encouraged, and balance gradually returned. This theory taught me that economic development isn’t just about GDP numbers—it’s also about whether the internal structure is coordinated and whether different industries can support each other.
